What we had really blew us away: FABULOUS food, big portions, and very friendly service. The decor was lacking, but we did not even notice it once we dug into our yummy food. Everyone in our group ordered something different and all got rave reviews. I had the tofu asparagus, and the veggies were all super fresh, not overcooked and the tofu was really cooked prefectly. This will be an addition to our regular rotation of great places to eat in WS!PS - one of our friends said the food alone was worth the drive to West Seattle...and he is from Issaquah!"

Kind of sparse &#160;decor, but I really like places that don't have clientele that spend most of their time at a restaurant posturing. The same reason I tend to stay away from whole foods,is the reason I like low key places like this. Okay price, okay portions- but very low key. Our favorite teriyaki in West Seattle! Generous portions of fresh, tasty, reasonably-priced food. The staff is super friendly, too. Seattle has a lot of great teriyaki. &#160;This spot has quality beef and nice portions with the shrimp teriyaki. All and all worth a stop by. &#160;Destination spot, no. &#160;Swing by if you are in the hood and looking for a teriyaki, you bet."

My husband and I didn't have high expectations but we did have a coupon. We were pleasantly surprised.The staff here is very friendly. I always get smiles and pleasantry. My water cup is always filled (and big to being with) and service is fast. I love their shrimp tempura, tempura rolls and Philly rolls. Highly recommended, but parking is a little hairy. Looks like a dive, tastes divine! I wish someone would nominate their restaurant for some sort of makeover, because I live in fear this aptly named place will go out of business due to people judging a book by its cover. The good news is there's always plenty of seating!I love to order the Chicken Asparagus with Gyoza. I give all my chicken, half my rice, and some of my veggies to my four-year-old. He loves to go there and often requests it by name. The proprietors are so nice to him, always giving us an extra small plate so we can share, a steak knife so I can cut up his chicken, and a little cup with ice and a straw for the drink he loves to pick out from the refrigerated case. It's a very family-friendly restaurant in one of the best senses -- you don't have to be a family to eat there, and I see all types of groups and individuals come through, but the owners are welcoming to all. As far as noise level, even with us there, it's not a library, but it's pretty chill.My husband likes to alternate between the seafood teriyaki dishes and the tempura. The meat there (when I try a bite) is well seasoned and cooked to be just soft enough. The veggies always seem super fresh and vibrantly colored and retain a pleasant crunch. Nothing's overcooked, is what I'm saying.The rice and teriyaki sauce are good, too. Ha ha.It can be a little challenging to find street parking in the Junction, so we usually pass it up, turn around near Rite-Aid, and then find street parking on the correct side of the street just past the light and walk down. If you do have little kids, know that it's right next to a cool toy store and near the pet store. If you have a four-year-old, you'll understand the appeal. Plus, you could walk to Husky Deli or Cupcake Royale for dessert if anyone still has room.Seriously, this is my favorite teriyaki place to go to, and one of my favorite restaurants, period. Despite the decor. I thought I walked into a two lane bowling alley. Long narrow walk to the counter and I felt like asking for bowling shoes and a beer. My first reaction was oh great another mediocre teriyaki joint. The place was fairly empty but the sun was shining and people were enjoying places with decks or views. I ordered the premium chicken and pork combo and was pleasantly surprised by how good the sauce was and the quality of the meat. Honestly this was some of the best teriyaki I have had in Seattle. Not sure it would be my #1 place in Seattle but definitely my top five for sure. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because I didn't much care for my salad and the interior needs a make over. (looked clean though) This is the type of place I wish I lived close too. You know- sometimes (especially if you spend a significant amount of time trying[maybe failing sometimes] to be considerate of others) &#160;I don't think I have any preferences or implicit expectations. I do. &#160;This place is popular with faaamilies. Not children and parents. BABIES and parents. &#160;I had forgotten how their sudden shrieks ( hey I get it- they can't speak and they may want to be moved slightly, burped, changed, fed I understand the function and necessity) &#160;can fully derail thoughts.Now it is a rather big place so this wasn't a huge deal. However as a student I generally expect noise to be background adult conversations, music or sounds of the open air kitchen/Mongolian grill.It was tasty, but as someone else said the portions (aside from the rice) were not generous. But it was quick without being fries or over priced starbucks sandwich and I will drink the free tea for as long as I can occupy the space without feeling guilty. Best Teriyaki In West Seattle! &#160;Food is fresh, Cooked perfectly, and service is very friendly and fast. Everything you could ask for in a local teriyaki place. I recommend the chicken teriyaki, chicken Katsu, and the combo meals are also great. Salad and and egg rolls are tasty as well! I have not tried much else simply because the staples are to good to try something new. Good prices, good food, fast take out! I didn't initially want to eat here, because as other reviews have stated the ambiance leaves quite a bit to be desired. &#160;But there's something about the way they marinade the meat with the perfect combo of savory/sweet that keep bringing me back. &#160;The teriyaki is always perfectly cooked, and maybe they brine the chicken in advance, but the chicken is always flavorful and juicy. &#160;I usually order the combo w/spicy chicken &amp; pork - I've ordered beef in the past but I think the chicken has more flavor. &#160;I've ordered the sesame chicken, chicken bento w/CA rolls, tempura, and masago rolls in the past and have never been disappointed by any of the dishes.5 stars for the food and 5 for the staff - very nice and friendly. &#160; Only 2 stars for ambiance. &#160;But I'm Asian, so who cares about ambiance and service? &#160; I'm all about the food.Comment on portions and value - &#160; Maybe I don't eat as much as the other reviews? &#160; It's good food with fast service but it's not fast food, so don't expect the McD dollar value menu. &#160; Unless you normally eat 2K+ calories for dinner and expect 5 portions of meat for less than $10, I don't understand the comments. &#160;I thought portions were quite generous! &#160;I usually don't finish all my food in 1 sitting. I'm probably the only person on here who isn't hugely impressed with their Teriyaki, specifically. However, their chicken katsu is to DIE for! It's tender and perfectly cooked, beautifully crispy on the outside, and you get enough of it to stuff a moose! Their rice is usually pretty overcooked, but the portion sizes are huge and their side salad is delicious! I've always gotten really nice service there and while the decor isn't exactly attractive, if you're busy properly stuffing your face you hardly even notice."

The decor looks miserable, the restrooms are right in the middle of the dining area, and they seemed to have an identity crisis - the menu was packed with all sorts of things you'd never expect a good teriyaki restaurant to have (udon? california rolls? korean BBQ short ribs? what?). Begrudgingly, I ordered a chicken teriyaki bento box (like in the picture someone else uploaded here) to satisfy my hunger.I've eaten at dozens of teriyaki restaurants in Washington, and I will state on the record that this place is in my top 5. The chicken was juicy and properly cooked - marinated in advance instead of having the sauce glaze over during cooking like some other places.I'm not a big fan of side salads with teriyaki, it's never really felt like a proper combination of flavor/texture to me. This time around it was no different, but I actually ended up starting and finishing my salad (a rarity) and even ENJOYING it. It's weird, but the way they cut their lettuce + awesomesauce dressing = palatable salad for me.Unless you're already in the area, I wouldn't recommend dining onsite as it's somewhat drab. Most people don't anyways - in the 20 minutes I was there, at least a dozen people came through to pickup their carryout orders. This place moves their product hardcore, and for good reason.P.S. Parking in the back! This place serves the best teriyaki in West Seattle. &#160;There are two main varieties that we get in Seattle. &#160;The traditional Japanese style which is broiled, then lathered with a soy based sweet sauce or the Korean derivation, that is grilled and covered in Korean BBQ inspired teriyaki sauce.The Korean variety is what Yummy serves. &#160;The meats are moist and well marinated before grilling. &#160;You can taste the difference. &#160;The complementary salad has a garlic miso based dressing that has a smooth and buttery texture, with a kick from the garlic. &#160;It actually inspires me to eat the salad.My favorite, the Spicy Teriyaki Chicken. &#160;You can't really go wrong with the bento combos either if you are in the mood for a little variety. &#160;This is not the best I've ever had but this is the best in the area, so it's become my go-to place when I crave some good teriyaki.Ambiance - none but it is clean. &#160;Parking is available in the alley but you will have to walk thru the kitchen. &#160;Again, clean. I stopped in to get dinner to go and was disappointed in the portion size - very stingy portions."

Not 5 minutes passed before we had piping hot chicken teriyaki in our hungry little hands and it smelled so good we could barely make the drive without digging into it. It also came with a pretty big portion of salad in its own container and I've gotta say it hit the spot! You probably wouldn't want to come in here and sit down for dinner (the place is enormous but there are only about five tables and it was completely empty when we stopped in) but for takeout, it's clean and friendly and you can recycle your to-go box :) Yummy Teriyaki is underrated and easily overlooked. &#160;Like most people, I love a great Teriyaki and can find a lot of them overly salted with Soy Sauce. &#160;Yummy Teriyaki is the perfect balance of sweet and salty and they use quality cuts of chicken that are cooked to please anyone craving a good Teriyaki. &#160;I highly suggest getting the Chicken Bento Box as it offers a variety of Teriyaki Chicken, Tempura and California Rolls with a side of Cabbage Salad with a tasty Sesame Cream Dressing. &#160;The staff is really nice and it's a clean spot to eat. &#160;Don't be discouraged if you walk in the door and see no customers seated; most people order over the phone and pick-up for takeout. &#160;They have a nice variety on the menu and all of the dishes I have ordered I have been more than pleased with. &#160;Go give them a try, you will not be disappointed. Love this joint. My goto in WS for teriyaki. We ordered take out. I got the Teriyaki chicken plate, he got the short ribs plate. Rice looked like it sat in a rice cooker all day.Teriyaki sauce had way too much ginger, and wasn't a good value for the price."

Definitely not a fancy place but still worth a visit. You order at the counter and someone brings your food to your table. I ordered a tofu teriyaki plate and it was quite good. It was basically a huge mound of white rice (brown would be a good option although I'm not sure if they have it) and a stir fry of sliced tofu and vegetables with teriyaki sauce. It was way too much to eat. My only complaint is that there are no fountain drinks, everything is bottled. I don't know why that bothers me but it does."

Keep in mind with all of my teriyaki place reviews are based off of how I like their spicy chicken (if available; automatic one-star if they don't have spicy chicken :P). Their spicy chicken isn't terribly spicy, but the cuts of meat are pretty decent, their rice is also good. Not a fan of whatever the dressing is that they use on their cabbage (I think that's what it is) side salad that comes with pretty much every menu item. Their tempura is tasty, I've had both the vegetable and prawn.I don't go there anymore as I'm not a fan of their spicy chicken, but since West Seattle (namely the Junction area) doesn't have a ton of teriyaki places this is one worth mentioning. If you're not a fan of spicy stuff I'm sure that their other menu items would be worth checking out. Also, if you order in it seems like you get a bigger portion than you do from a take-out order."

Tried the place down the street... are they kidding me with that grocery store brand coffee? This is SEATTLE for god's sake!Blue Saucer every time! I've gone in several times since moving to the neighborhood and we've always had a great experience. The outdoor seating is nice in good weather, and the coffee has always been excellent. They even do a nice warmed cider for kids. We have always had great experiences with the baristas who are very kind to our children. I'm glad there's a coffee shop so near to the house that is this good. I've only been here a few times, but they've got to be doing something right to still be in business. &#160;I've lived 2 blocks away from this place for over 25 years and they've been able to remain longer than any other place on the corner there. I'm not a big coffee drinker, but if I was this is the place I'd be. It's probably not worth driving across the city to visit the Blue Saucer, but if you live in the neighborhood this is the place you should go. They've got some sweet Maple Leaf t-shirts too. It's a coffee shop with the feel of a breakfast nook, And a north Seattle Prius driving bike rack toting close knit Clientele. The coffee is good, But good luck with trying to order something to eat. The menu is far from self explanatory. While you decipher this instruction manual The locals look about casually Pretending not to be paying attention to this spectacle that has all the makings of a game show Called Stomp the alien. The barista is your host, reluctantly giving you clues To help you fill in the blanks that the menu failed to provide. All in all the coffee was good, The sandwich was delicious, And the service was fair. But if you've never been there before an ambiguous menu can create an uncomfortable experience. I came here 5-6 days a week for month, hoping to pin this place as my new coffee shop. No go. Here's my beef: I drink an americano with room and my drink still gets fudged. There are a couple great baristas here (the girl with the brown bob and the girl with long dark hair and glasses) but both of the baristas I see most frequently make substandard coffee and give crappy service. Either the shots get that burnt/bitter thing going on, there's no room (I always ask and politely, too) or both. I work in customer service too, so I try to cut people slack. It's harder work than a lot of people realize, but there's no excuse. The coffee (it's not Stumptown, people) in combination with the service (the blond haired barista is sooooo slow because she really likes to listen to herself talk) isn't worth it.So after coming here around 25 times, spending around $125-150 on coffee and pastries and having been served totally lame coffee (by the owner even, she's not delivering, why would her employees?) I'm not coming back. Instead, I've been walking the extra 10 blocks to Javasti and I haven't been disappointed by their coffee once. I just started coming in here, and with my extensive knowledge of coffee bean cultivation, roasting, brewing, and espresso preparation, I can say with an informed opinion that the new girl is super cute. Everything else seems fine too. I moved into the neighborhood last year. It took me a couple months before I finally decided to stop in and get coffee. Glad I did! Great coffee, friendly atmosphere, and delicious sandwiches.Their coffee is consistently delicious, but you sometimes have to wait a little longer than you would at a place like Stabucks. In my mind, totally worth it for the jump in quality. The same goes for their bagel sandwiches (which they make there). I crave those things pretty much every morning.The people who work there are nice and really take the time to get to know the customers. Everyone is very welcoming, you feel like part of a community when you are there (like it should feel in Maple Leaf!). I've met some great people who live in my neighborhood just sitting there sipping coffee.To sum up, don't wait to try this place like I did! Some people just don't know a good thing if its staring them in the face. This place is great. Never had any trouble with the cute blonde or a burnt bagel. Some people need a reality check. Right on the way to work, quick service, and a cute blonde barista. great drinks and a friendly atmosphere. A+ There is a girl who works on the weekends who won't utter a word to you - ignores your hello even! &#160;I'll still stop by, but I wish &#160;they were ALL friendly!"

The Hellfire Mocha) are so great and cheap that I would come here even if there were some sort of soup-Nazi-like bastard behind the counter. &#160;But there is not. &#160;The people here are actually really chill and nice.The homemade marshmallows are great as well and should not be missed.The bagel sandwiches are damn good! &#160;I had the jalape&#241;o bagel with ham, egg, and melted havarti and it was delicious. &#160;It tasted like a high quality black forest ham and the bagel definitely rivaled NYC's best.The Stumptown coffee is fantastic and is not even in the same ballpark as the over-roasted crap they sling at Starbucks.And finally, I don't really understand some of the negative reviews on here... &#160;I actually hate most restaurants and coffee shops as few people actually know what they are doing in the food service business. &#160;But come on... some of these complaints are just silly. &#160; I mean, they have about 10 different types of black tea! &#160;Can't you at least try one of them before bitching about it? &#160;Complaining that you have to wait in line when they are busy? &#160;Maybe they are busy because they are good...hmmmmm. &#160;If you want it faster, go to the drive-thru Starbucks and drink their crappier coffee for the same price. Happy place to find (again)! &#160; When I first moved here, I stopped to get a muffin &amp; coffee (both kick ass) and then being new to Seattle and not taking note of the place, I sadly couldn't find it again for like 4 LOOOOOONGGGGG months. &#160;Drove by a couple of weeks ago (lost, like always) and saw it out of the corner of my eye. &#160;Breve &amp; Lattes are both wonderful. &#160;So strong but not that burnt aftertaste that you get at some coffee places. &#160;Pastries are FRESH, moist, so damn good. &#160;Make the trip, even if it's out of your way. Well worth it! Stopped by this cute little coffee house last Sunday. I ordered a chai tea and a morning glory muffin, my husband had a mocha and an apple fritter. The drinks were great and the pastries were yummy. &#160;The two barista's [I think they were both Jessica's] were so friendly!We will definetly be going back! This place is so cute. &#160;They've got great coffee, awesome sandwiches, a vast tea selection, and a super staff. &#160;I had one of their melted sandwiches and it was freaking amazing. &#160;This is a great place to go and just chill on those dreary days. &#160;Cori and the other barista's make for good, friendly company!Their ""drip coffee"" is actually french press coffee which is all that much better! &#160;I dig the glass mugs! Had a quick cappacino here, but it looked like they had great pastries, bagel sandwiches, etc. We loved this place. &#160;Great food friendly staff and the hellfire mocha with homemade marshmallow was awesome. &#160;I will come back here over and over again."

The atmosphere is nice enough but it's a little chilly in the cold weather. The prices seem okay to me. They claimed to carry some gluten free baked goods from time to time but I have not seen anything yet. One star off.The service is so-so and that is where I take two stars off. &#160;If I order a drink to go, I think it's extremely poor service to take my money then take orders and money from the two or three customers in line behind me before you start to make my drink. &#160;If I'm not in a hurry and I'm sitting down to drink it I don't care, but when I say it's to go that's because &#160;I have somewhere I need to be. &#160;They may think that's good business, I suppose I will not leave if they have my money but I don't have a drink yet, but guess what? Yesterday when I was needing a latte I drove past to the next stop because I don't want to get stuck waiting for my drink while they collect everyone's cash. &#160;NOT good business. All I wanted was some black tea. That and something to eat. What coffeehouse doesn't carry a plain black tea? &#160;Some oolong or English Breakfast or even Red Rose? &#160;It appears Blue Saucer is that place.I like the interior, very homey and comfortable with a side of hippie. The staff is very friendly and helpful but I will not be back because of the 15 odd teas they have not one is drinkable. &#160;Everything was flavored and I don't do flavors. &#160;I did enjoy my toasted bagel but the quiche was the worst I have ever had. &#160;The crust had disappeared during the nuking process and the cheese was grainy in my mouth. &#160;Food is an afterthought here. &#160;Coffee drinkers will enjoy the Stumptown they serve but if you drink tea, avoid this place. A little over two years ago, my wife and I moved up to 1986's Neighborhood of the Year. We were warmly welcomed to the community by a drunk driver who careened into our townhouse. This minor inconvenience occurred the morning of our arrival and so we sat outside with our truck full of furniture, wondering how we were going to get into our new digs. As we surveyed the damage, Billie (the owner of the Blue Saucer) came by and offered us a genuine welcome to the neighborhood. It was a nice touch, and we've been good neighbors ever since.It turns out that the Blue Saucer was starting up around the same time that we were. They hit the right notes right away by opting to serve Stumptown Coffee, a personal favorite of mine. At the time, you could also pick from a small selection of snacks, read from a small section of books and magazines, and expect pretty much the kind of things you'd expect from many coffee shops in Seattle. Since then, this shop has expanded and revamped just about everything but the coffee. This has been a good thing; the Blue Saucer now has tons of nice breakfast selections (including oatmeal, which is a huge bonus for me), fun special events, even affogato (ice cream courtesy of Parfait) during the summer. For all these changes, I can still expect the same quality coffee and friendly service. It's really nice to have a place like this (literally) just across the street. I live in the neighborhood of this cozy and easy to access coffee cafe. &#160;They serve Stumptown, which is excellent in comparison to the other coffee offerings around the area. &#160;They also have some great looking/tasting pastries and lunch menu items. &#160;Their customer service has always been less than ideal. &#160;For some reason, I have never experienced a friendly barista in there since they opened. &#160;I'm not a regular for that reason; sometimes they are actually unfriendly. &#160;I'd rather brew a french press coffee at home with my nice and friendly husband than pay for that. Since I now work in Northgate, I now have to get used to Roosevelt Way and that awful traffic back up by the mall everyday at 4 PM. &#160;Regardless of my rant, I decided to break away from my morning routine of boring, lifeless Starbucks mocha and wanted to go somewhere different. &#160;After whipping out my trusty Yelp app on my IPHONE (insert shameless Apple Plug here), I came across this lovely gem. &#160;While the parking lot in front is hard to get into when its full and traffic is coming in a flash before your eyes, I was finally able to park in back and go in. &#160;The place is very homely and quaint.  &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I decided to try the Hellfire mocha, because I am a fan of spicy chocolate. &#160;Nothing like cayenne pepper to put some spice in your workday at 9 AM. &#160;The blend was perfect, not too overpowering and the espresso shots were pulled perfectly, in true Stumptown fashion &#160;:). &#160;I was not too impressed with the pastries, since most of them look store brought or manufactured. &#160;I could be wrong since I just got a bagel and cream chesse, but maybe I should come back for lunch and have one of their sandwiches. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The baristas were super nice and were greeting people who were coming in the doorway. &#160;That to me is refreshing! &#160;I thought I received the right amount of customer service and I did not feel rushed or was given any condescending looks. &#160;I will definitely be back for the hellfire mocha alone &#160;:) I've lived a couple blocks a way from Blue Saucer's location for a few years now and watched several businesses try &amp; fail to gain footing in our little community. &#160;Under Billie's management, Blue Saucer has flourished. &#160;Great Stumptown coffee, great customer service, and none of the pretense found at Cloud City. &#160;Free ""doggie biscotti"" for your pooch seals the deal for me. &#160;You have to go to Blue Saucer, just don't steal my seat ;). I decided to stop in here because I didn't feel like dealing with the crowd at cloud city. However to my surprise, even with only a few people inside, I still feel like I waited just as long. &#160;I'm a big fan of stumptown espresso, but the cappuccino I ordered tasted gritty and dense. I'm also a little disappointed with the food...none of the pastries look to be baked in house. They kind of look like they were bought at costco and have been sitting there for days. Other than their coffee being a little on the dense side, I LOVE this place. &#160;So small, warm, welcoming, and cozy. &#160;They have good bagels sandwiches and the staff is so friendly. &#160;Great year round! Totally awesome small coffee shop with super friendly service and atmosphere. I love the Stumptown coffee and homemade cupcakes! I patronize this place practically everyday. &#160;My only problem, they don't carry the Stranger. &#160;When I asked why, the barista said because ""this is a family place"". I'm a little offended and disturbed about that. &#160;I don't have a family and want to read the Stranger and I live in Maple Leaf. &#160;My moneys green, don't I count too? Wonderful coffee, one of my favorite burritos in the whole city, super-nice staff and owner, indoor and outdoor seating and off-street parking. What more could you ask? I love this place -- just a nice feel to it and good food and people to boot."

This place has been (and continues to be) a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Congratulations to Billie and crew for reviving this location and bringing a much needed coffee house to Maple Leaf. I've had many an iced mocha here over the summer, and plan to have many more- After reading a few reviews I felt the need to throw in my two cents. I was just as skeptical as everyone else in the neighborhood when &#160;Blue Saucer moved in on the corner of NE 92nd. However after my first visit the skepticism dissipated. The owner has done a good in building her business in the community. I mainly drink tea now so I haven't tried the coffee but I will. The staff is friendly and nice. It has become a part of the neighborhood which can be difficult when you have a few shops in the neighborhood. They have a great selection of teas which I love and the fact they offer french press coffee versus drip really impressed me. I am a fan of french press. They offer a diverse selection in baked goods in my opinion. Someone commented in another post they don't make their own baked goods and consider it a negative which I have to disagree. Simply because if you are selling coffee you shouldn't be making baked goods leave that to a local bakery that does an amazing job. If I recall the coffee shop down the street doesn't make their goodies either. Again focusing on what you do well wins you more customers than trying to do everything and not doing it well. I hope they continue to focus on what they do well and let those that don't like it toddle off to Starbucks where you wait in line for 30 minutes while the ""barista"" pushes a button and their coffee comes out as the machine intended. As a veteran coffee drinker pulling a shot is not the same as having a machine do it. There is so much more flavor when it is pulled. Kudos to Blue Saucer for taking coffee back to it's roots. A time before coffee was burned and a mass marketed monopoly. Hey I need to update this! This place has gotten even better with the best tasting coffee in the neighborhood served with warm, friendly service. You should check it out--it will soon be your regular place.They now have ""Cupcake Wednesdays"", where Billie makes cupcakes that have: a) amazing flavors; b) fresh ingredients; and c) love packed into every bite. They no longer have Look Cupcakes on the weekends, but nobody misses them with a tasty new ""hump day"" flavor to look forward to every week.To give you everything you might find somewhere else, they added grab and go drip Stumptown coffee for the morning rush and additional food items. There is now oatmeal and tasty savory options, including a few sandwiches, and burritoy things. So all slight negatives from my previous review were eliminated. Way to listen to the neighborhood and keep getting better Blue Saucer. The coffee is OK, a little over priced for the size of cup you get. The service is decent, nothing in this place is spectacular minus their spicy mexican mocha which is very good and unique. Overall, its an ""ok"" place but sadly is located very near a few other remarkable coffee shops. As a fellow Maple Leafer I also love going there in the morning for my Mocha fix with a sweet marshmallow. The coffee Peeps are great and are always nice and can make a great drink.. Now If I could get a nice Bourbon latte then I'm all set. I have the same story as Adrian! &#160;I just moved into the neighborhood and was trying all the coffee places. The other coffee shop on Roosevelt had teeerrrrrrible coffee - so I threw it away and pulled into Blue Saucer. I LOVE the girls that work here - they make my day brighter. I always look forward to my visits here. I love these guys - they have the nicest servers, they move quickly on making your coffee, their specialty coffees are a lot of fun and the baked goods are fresh and yummy. &#160;What a great neighborhood hangout! Very nice barista. I'm nocturnal, so I never hit a coffee house before 3 pm Can't tell you what it's like in the AM, but it's a nice place, doesn't feel cramped, although it looks tiny from the street. My first taste of Stumptown, so maybe this explains the surprising taste of my mocha: not at all like chocolate. It tasted like oranges. Not bad, just not what I was expecting."

I was worried I'd feel funny hanging out in there while I used the wifi one day (maybe like the other person said about sterility) but no, I felt welcome. The people seem nice and are nice to my baby when I come in.Here are the things I wish it had:- a bigger sized iced coffee! &#160;(I'm an addict I guess)- that they didn't always run out of pastries and such before I get there - (scones, muffins)- a corner for kiddos would be cool (that might be too much to ask for given it's sizesome things I love:- ginger molasses cookies!!!- simple syrup for iced coffee I have to make a comment about ""Just Y's"" review. First off I have to add I am bias because I have been working at Blue Saucer since almost the beginning (WHICH WE HAVE NOW BEEN OPEN FOR A YEAR! CONGRATS!)First off I don't know if this person has ever actually visited or viewed temporary housing, but if this is what temporary housing looks like, anyone would be lucky to live there. Blue Saucer is beautiful and Billie and Eric have spent a lot of time working hard on creating a beautiful atmosphere. People are constantly complimenting how cute and inviting the shop is. Second, this person makes a comment about our ""kitchen"" and that the pastries are not made in-house. We have never claimed that they are made in the shop. We are proud to offer pastries from local Seattle bakeries and we hope to someday add on a kitchen so that can provide home made goods (which will be awesome because Billie really does make the BEST goodies). It is only our first year and as most our customers have the compassion to understand our dreams and goals for this shop and are excited to see us grow.Lastly, the comment about the coffee. We proudly serve Stumptown coffee and our drinks are based off of Stumptown's philosophy. Two shots in any size is how Stumptown trained us to make our drinks. HOWEVER, if this customer had mentioned their feelings about the drink to a barista we would have happily informed them that if for just 60 cents more they decided to throw in that third shot, we would give them the 4th for free since our machine pull two shots at a time. Where else do you get two shots for the price of 1? We are a very warm and friendly place that does its best at making our customers happy. However, we are unable to do this job if the customer does not speak their concerns to us but decide to go directly to Yelp and bash us with just one visit. We are a new business that is happy to take any suggestion. However, speaking to a person who works with the company is always the best way to make a change. In addition I would like to add this is a great shop and we really do have THE BEST CUSTOMERS! Maple Leaf is a great community and I know we appreciate all our customers who are excited to see us going strong! I LOVE the Blue Saucer! &#160; Maple Leaf really needed a place like this where anyone can go for a perfect cup of coffee AND great service. &#160;You are always greeted by a smile as if the baristas are genuinely happy to see you. &#160;It is incredibly refreshing to have such amazing service every time I go there. &#160;The fact that they serve Stumptown coffee is the icing on the cake. &#160;C'mon Maple Leafers, give it a try - you know you deserve a good cup of coffee. Really really good ""sustainable"" coffee and pastries are great quality. &#160;Free wi-fi, we walk here every weekend for our Sunday morning coffee. Blue Saucer is a great neighborhood coffee shop. &#160;They use Stumptown coffee and brew it right. &#160;The baristas are friendly, and seem to remember every customer and what their regular drink is. &#160;They also have a good selection of baked goods from Essential Baking Company and Macrina Bakery.Blue Saucer is worth the trip - once you go, you'll want to be a regular! Very nice little coffee shop with a nice vibe to it. At first it looks somewhat sterile, I think, but after just a few minutes it gets cozy and you have to kick yourself out again and go run your errands. Coffee was very good, but I have yet to try the other treats. Good coffee, good service, good location, good wireless. &#160;What's not to like? &#160;Serving Stumptown coffee. A bright, cheerful place to sit and work on a laptop of enjoy a cup of coffee with friends. &#160;The Blue Saucer is a quieter, friendlier place than the ""edgier"" and frenetic Cloud City Coffee a few blocks south. &#160;(I like both.) Blue Saucer is a great neighborhood coffee shop. Excellent coffee, good selection of baked goods, and a &#160;friendly and relaxing atmosphere. It's nice to see Maple Leaf attracting more independent businesses like this---please support them."

Perfect neighborhood coffee house run by an extremely sweet woman (Billie, I believe). Good coffee, nice vibe, some outdoor seating.Must go back and try the famous Hellfire Mocha soon. Cute little coffee shop!!!! They also have a variety of other goodies too :) from pastries, to wraps, cookies, and lemonade!!My best friend lives literally a house away from this place. &#160;We've never been in this place! It's soo cute, and homey feeling! &#160;The barista that was in was so helpful &amp; friendly. &#160;I got the homemade lemonade &amp; it was soo refreshing :) &#160;It just opened in March, I know this place will get a lot busier! The Stumptown coffee rocks. The baristas are super friendly and they make DEE-LISHUS drinks. And by that, I mean all of the baristas - no worrying about who's working when to get a good drink and a friendly attitude. The teas are tasty, too. WiFi is pass-protected, but otherwise easy. The interior is cute and homey without being over-the-top. Booth seats are comfy and there are outdoor loungers with umbrellas, too. Also plenty of easy parking, for those of you who need an easy stop-off on the way to the freeway for your morning commute. Also big bonuses on the condiment bar: easy self-serve water and simple syrup (for iced drinks). The only food I've tried is the bagel+cream cheese, which was fine (they gave me 2 cream cheese packets without me even having to ask!) They also play really good music. I know it's tough to select things that won't annoy people (punk) nor make them puke (lite rock). So glad this place is now in my 'hood.Note: I think some of the Cafe Neo reviews actually belong here. I'm not quite sure when they changed over, but Blue Saucer is the current incarnation and I hope it's here to stay! It's refreshing to find a local coffee shop that remembers your name and your drink! Billie and her staff are grrrreat plus Stumptown coffee, Macrina pastries, Mighty-O donuts and wi-fi - what more could you want! It's cozy inside and there's plenty of seating outside plus even leash tie-ups for my pooch. Maple Leaf is lucky to have them here! Delicious coffee, friendly staff, pleasant environment and gluten-free treats (finally, my 3-year old can have a treat at a coffee shop!), a few blocks from home &#160;- what more could you ask?!"

I usually get it &#160;to go and they give you a lot of broth in one of those large plastic containers. The broth is really good, my only complaint is the broth is a little greasy than other places, but does not take away from the taste at all. The eggrolls are pretty good too!"

Paper bags and bring-your-own. Natural. Organic. Grass-fed. Alternative. Bulk. Everything you'd expect at a healthy foods store, including the higher prices. Location:Near the Fremont Bridge in Seattle. Parking:There's parking underground, though I've often found street parking. Quality:Earth and green friendly organic natural foods. Service:No hotties, or eye-candy, &#160;but the people have been okay with service. Return?:Probably if I'm in the neighbourhood. The journey to PCC is an exercise of frustration filled with contempt. Fremont, otherwise self-indulgently known as the ""Center of the Universe"" (which, I'm sure, is held by another equally arrogant town), is situated by a canal and surrounded by hills littered by poor drivers, oblivious pedestrians and poorly designed city streets.However contemptible this neighborhood is with all its pretension I can't help but find the lunch options at PCC to be incredibly delicious. Their prepackaged salads are always fresh and their small hot food selection always fit the bill, whatever my mood.If I'm in a particularly good mood, I even play a little game of ""I spy with my eye an ironically-tattooed hipster, wannabe-green yuppie, mom-with-too-many-kids-in-tow or old-pony-tailed hippie"" to alleviate the short but frustrating drive into civil Hades.But $0.79 for a thing of dressing? C'mon! (-1 star) Yes it's one of the most expensive supermarkets you will ever go to. However, some of the brands here are actually cheaper because of how many people go here, so it's not bad for some stuff like Fage yogurt. Also, if you order an entire case of whatever product, they give you 10% off for it being a bulk order. If you're a member, they send out a coupon in their newsletter for 10% off your entire purchase once a month. However, what you pay for in price you definitely get for the freshness and quality. They also have the largest vitamin selection I've come across in any grocery store, and very nice personal and home goods from natural and holistic brands. All of the produce and meats are also labeled from local, sustainable vendors. They also have the nicest dry foods section that I've ever seen--all of the most tasty granola, trail mix and that sort of food. The hot foods section is also pretty good as long as you're at PCC not too late for the freshest selection. This PCC location is the nicest one that I've been to in the Seattle area. The workers at PCC are all very helpful and knowledgeable, and really care about helping you out. All in all, yes they are pricey but it's worth it. PCC is a very pricey grocery store. &#160;I routinely shop at one of their competitors (Whole Foods), and I find many more bargains there. &#160;I rely on PCC for ice cream, bread, wine/cider, and other little treats, but it just doesn't offer the value or selection I need. &#160; I think many regulars rely on it for prepared foods (I don't shop for those very often) from the deli).So 4-5 stars for treats, but only 2 stars for price &amp; selection, thus, 3 stars overall. Out of all the organic/natural food stores, PCC is my top choice, and this location is perfectly convenient for me! &#160;I shop at PCC for their fresh produce, grass-fed meats, organic dairy products, beer/wine section and of course the made-to-go foods. &#160;PCC offers quality ingredients and products for a reasonable price and I always feel taken care of here. &#160;Also, it doesn't hurt that there's a covered parking lot too! Here is to my 100! review.When living in Seattle I have tended to end up living near a PCC and for good reason. There isn't a better grocery store in Seattle. Cheaper? Oh yeah, just try Safeway or QFC but try finding quality organic anything. Besides, the up-cost of organic products is simply what one should be paying. Mostly, this place just rules for the quality of its staff, its great produce and its homegrown status. PCC has a great ready-to-eat prepared foods section, which is fantastic when I don't feel like cooking (which is every night) and don't feel like restaurant food (which is not that often, but does happen). &#160;Their pizza is actually surprisingly good. &#160;Yes PCC is expensive, but so is every natural foods store. &#160;Their produce is excellent and selection on other stuff is quite good. I shop here quit a bit for various items and I would love to give you more stars but there are several shortfalls that the out-of-town Whole Foods has figured out.No seating except for outside! &#160;Three or four tables in winter just isn't enough. &#160;You are in the middle of an urban area with lots of day-lunch crowd, find a way for more tables inside the store PLEASE! Oh! Emerald City Salad, Smoked Mozzarella Pasta Salad, Yummy Flavored Tofu, and Dolma how do I love thee....let me count the ways! The reason I love this location of PCC so much has got to be the quality of the staff and the offerings in the deli section here. Not to mention the fact that this PCC has a parking garage right underneath it for those days when everybody and their dog is enjoying Fremont. The prices of the grocery items are a little pricier than than your average grocery store, but keep in mind that you are getting higher quality organic foods and gluten free options rather than your typical grocery fare. Also, how many grocery stores offer opportunities for cooking classes with their talented staff and a podcast? (Check out their website @ http://www.pccnaturalmar&#8230; ) Don't forget, this location is also open 6am-Midnight &#160;daily making shopping for better food options possible for those of us who work too much. Check this location out, you will be sure to discover something new and most like quite tasty with each visit! The best store to find food in Seattle. Forget about whole foods. Mecca. &#160;Immaculate, beautifully designed store. &#160;Fantastic deli food. &#160;Really great staff. &#160; As a vegan, I bring my lunch to work most of the time. &#160;If I forget, their hot deli bar always has some great vegan options. &#160;I love their card selection. &#160;I can always find something that's just right for the moment. &#160;Black beans and rice in the hot food section is very satisfying. &#160;And they have cool things like nutritional yeast in the condiment area. &#160;if you like good, healthy, well made, well sourced food - I think it's the best in the city. &#160;Vegan donuts, scones and muffins, too. Love this store, but calling them is freakin' pointless. My attempt to save gas by calling to see if they have certain seasonal varieties of produce (Apples) has been in vain. They'll put you on hold repeatedly and like goldfish completely forget you're there. C'mon. The more I learn about ""Big Agriculture"", and &#160;the corporate machine that is how our food is grown and distributed (and sprayed with toxic pesticides), the more I want to spend every penny of my food budget at PCC. &#160;It's so important to me that my food is organic and sourced as much as possible from local and organic farms. &#160;The produce is better than any conventional grocery store, hands down. &#160;And the staff is always friendly and are starting to feel like my second family! &#160;Thanks for all the work you do to save organic farmland... Fremont store is the most friendly store of all. Even during the Fremont fair they extended full courtesy to every single member of the mad rush that hit the store. Great selection as usual and Thanks for serving us. staff is usually pretty decent, but i've had a few crappy cashiers. &#160;insulting your courtesy clerk in front of customers doesn't make you look cool, ultra-hipster cashier lady. &#160;just sayin'.and this may not be breaking news, but there's a parking garage under the store! &#160;holy crap! &#160;i'd been struggling with the shitty back-in parking on 34th or parking blocks and blocks away for almost a year. &#160;stupid me, i guess.it would be really awesome if i could get frozen loaves of bread (rudi's 7 grain and flax) instead of the horribly molested loaves on the shelves... but everytime i ask (at any PCC), they're o""out of that one"". &#160;boo. I primarily shop at PCC. &#160;Quality is great and staff is friendly. &#160;It's refreshing to have a store with more choice of bulk grains than types of potato chips. &#160;My main complaint is I still need to go to a Safeway or Fred Meyer on occasion for a few staples that PCC either doesn't carry, or the organic items are in the wrong quantity or too pricy (e.g., a five-pound bag of sugar). &#160;I would like it if they could deviate from their ""pureness"" a little without becoming a Whole Foods. PCC is a great supermarket for natural food and household products. &#160;If quality organics and information regarding the source of your food is important to you, this is your grocery store. Special diet? They can help. They are great at listing ingredients and employees throughout the store are helpfull and know their stuff, just ask. I highly recommend trying their deli food as well, just ask for a sample!"

I mean really, HOW DO I BEGIN A CANONIZATION PROCESS? I KNOW I'M NOT CATHOLIC! I love a Pretzel grinder, I don't care what you put on it. &#160;Oh, except for whatever a ""Smart"" pretzel grinder is in the PCC, I assume that means no meat. That sucks. &#160;With meat? That's a sandwich. &#160;Put mine on a pretzel roll.HARMONICA/GUITAR COMEDY SINGER GUY: If you've been here, you know this guy, the long grey pony tail favored by the most streotypically awful Seattle faux-hippie. &#160;This one has the harmonica setup though I've never seen him play it. &#160;I've almost never seen him play guitar or sing either. &#160;Mostly he does an endless monologue of stupid leftist political material. &#160;No-one going in or out has time to hear much of it, but the people sitting on the little patio are tortured by this idiot for the entire time they sit. &#160;Hey, it's Seattle, I'm sure we all love a Sarah Palin joke but FOR TWO FULL HOURS WHILE WE'RE TRYING TO EAT OUR LUNCH, NO, HEY PONY TAIL GUY, PLAY SOME FUCKING SEGER OR SHUT UP!BEER AISLE: I've never worked this close to a grocery store before, this one has a fantastic selection of microbrew. &#160;Ever have a bad day at the office but 2 minutes after standing up at your desk you are in front of the cooler picking out the six high-alcohol IPAs that are going to foggy up your brain in JUST 30 MINUTES FROM NOW AND LET YOU FORGET SO YOU CAN PEEL YOURSELF OUT OF YOUR WARM BED TOMORROW AND GO BACK TO WORK AND TAKE YOUR BEATING. YET. AGAIN.???? Well I have. &#160;Ferreting that paper bag full of hoppy goodness back to my car at 5:50 p.m. is high point of any number of work days. &#160;I DON'T TAKE MUCH JOY FROM MY WORK. &#160;I'm off topic.SAVE THE CHILDREN: Boy, when you put your head down and pretend like you don't see 'Save the Children' there's a little pang of guilt. &#160;I suspect they know this because they station like 6 of them around in some kind of ambushy manuever they must have learned from confiscated Viet Cong manuals. &#160;Feels like there are hundreds of them! I always mutter something like ""no, thanks"" like the people care about MY RETORT. &#160;The right way must be to just hustle past, right? Like you never even saw the 100 solicitors with the matching T-Shirts and the clipboards??? HOLD OUR CLIPBOARD IN YOUR HANDS BECAUSE ONCE YOU DO THAT YOU WILL HAVE TO GIVE US FIVE DOLLARS OR CHILDREN WILL NOT BE SAVED, NO YOU CANNOT JUST TAKE OUR LITERATURE AND 'THINK ABOUT IT', THINKING TIME IS OVER AND NOW IT IS WALLET TIME OR CLIPBOARD STAYS, LOOK AT ALL THESE PIECES OF PAPER AND OUR T-SHIRTS. MONEY NOW.FOCCACIA SANDWICHES: I think I spelled that wrong but I'm too lazy to look it up. &#160;Note, these must be grilled. &#160;It takes what they claim is 5 minutes but when you're waiting for a sandwich to be grilled it seems like TWO HOURS but anyone who gets them cold belongs in a lunatic asylum. &#160;These are all good. &#160;I had a Turkey and Havarti (melty) with red onions the other day I'm still thinking about. &#160;My standby is the falafel which is kind of sissy and Seattle and DON'T JUDGE ME.BIKE LANE: &#160;This is a one way street but the bike lane technically makes it two lanes. &#160;I walk across that street to get my lunch. &#160;Hey, biker, I don't care if McGinn makes this city BIKE ONLY I DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THIS LANE AS ACTUAL TRAFFIC AND I WILL NOT LOOK BOTH WAYS ONLY THE WAY THE CAR IS COMING AND IF YOU HIT ME I WILL BRING A PHALANX OF ATTORNIES DOWN ON YOU AND BURY YOU AND SIEZE YOUR BIKE AND CUT IT INTO PIECES AND TOSS IT IN MY HOARDER NEIGHBORS YARD. &#160;So don't give me any snippy attidtude when you have to dodge me crossing because I simply don't care. &#160;Get a car. &#160;THIS ISN'T HOLLAND.MEAT: I'm all grass-fed baby. &#160;Michael Pollan's smug ass has a convert here. &#160;PCC gets me my grass-fed steer. &#160;Corn fed can haul. &#160;My Omega 3 count is EXPANDING EXPONENTIALLY. &#160;FEAR MY OMEGA 3 COUNT.WEIRD SUPPLEMENT AISLE: What is all this crap? This is all fraud. &#160;Oh, oh, wait....except for my Omega 3 supplements. &#160;That will eventually make me telepathic and I will live to be a hundred and see hoverboards decimate the bicycle population.CHEESE DEPARTMENT: If you hang out here any longer than three minutes the cheese guy will give you cheese to try. &#160;Not bother you asking you what you're looking for, this cheese guy knows full well I haven't the foggiest what the fuck I'm looking for, he can tell I grew up in Orange County and remain flabbergasted that the swiss cheese with the holes in it is NOT A GOURMET CHEESE! It sure was in my house. &#160;This cheese guys says HEY EAT THIS AND THEN BUY IT DUMMY! &#160;Which I do.Yelp is telling me I'm out of space. &#160;Alas, so much more unsaid ..... Ok, it can be on the pricey side. &#160;But if you care about your health, eating organic and local, you will want to check this place out. &#160;I prefer to buy all my produce from here. &#160;VEGANS: &#160;this is the go-to place for vegan deli items and cakes, cookies, pies. &#160;The deli and bakery are awesome! This place is great! It can be expensive depending on what you buy, but it seems like there are also some pretty good deals. I bought organic Pink Lady apples for $1.99/lb and an entire pineapple for $3 (AND they'll core and slice it for you!). The organic version is just $1 more. The produce, as far as I've seen, is beautifully fresh, which is not always the case at other grocery stores. I've bought other stuff as well, but it's the produce that'll keep me coming back! you are soo close to my work. and have mostly everything i need! plus your employees are ssooooo freindly. After shopping @ PCC for the past few years (houghton location) I didn't think it could get much better. Since moving to Seattle, my boyfriend &amp; I were looking for grocery store nearby- the closest being whole foods. We decided to make the extra few minutes drive to go this PCC and let me tell you it was WELL worth it! This PCC feels so much better stocked &amp; much larger. The parking was easy free &amp; underground and their produce selection is perfect! Some of the most delicious apples i've ever had :)Note: Being a vegan- rarely do I get the privilege of enjoy pizza and when I do it's usually from Pizza Pi on the Ave. After our long/extensive grocery trip this girl was hungry, so I ventured over to the hot food section &amp; to my surprise found VEGAN PIZZA. It looked.... bleh not that great but I was really hungry and figured i'd try it out. HOLY COW BATMAN! Talk about yummy goodness. It knocked Pizza Pi out of the water &amp; it didn't even have vegan cheese. It was really THAT good, I could go on and on about it. So all in all, this PCC get's my five stars plus ++++ many kudos for their tasty pizza which next time i will buy not by the slice but, the whole damn pizza!! Oh boy. The dangers of living right above this place! The smell of the pizza baking late night is especially dangerous. The prices are ridiculously outrageous, the produce variety is out of this world and fresh, the prepared foods are relatively healthy AND tasty. I only allow myself to go in for the last minute items I need for dinner THAT day and save my weekly trips for Trader Joe's, and the farmer's markets, otherwise, I'd need a second job! ps they have wine tastings on Thursdays. The produce at PCC is fantastic. I asked the produce guy (joe) to help me pick out a watermelon (I know, but I'm so bad at it) one night at midnight and he was friendly and helpful, not only picking one out for me, but also giving me a lesson. PCC is reliably fresh and offers a great selection of Prosecco and chocolates. Of course, it's also reliably more expensive, but you pay for the quality, selection, local specialties, and organic everything. I believe in PCC. If I lived in Fremont, I would probably go broke because of this place. &#160;Unlike the View Ridge PCC, this one is huge and well-stocked. &#160;The produce looked fresher, too. &#160;I stopped by today and had a delicious prosciutto and mozzarella sandwich. &#160;I also picked up a bottle of wine that was a surprisingly good deal.For high-quality specialty products with a hefty pricetag overall, this is the place to go. This PCC is not very different from other stores, though it does seem slightly bigger. The selections are great, there's a lot of deli food that is tasty and fresh, and this particular location really has Fremont spelled all over it. It seems better stocked, with a bigger selection of local foods, and has a very nice audience shopping here regularly. Overall, great place to get your groceries if you are a foodie and don't mind spending some extra buck on local/organic/sustainable. I'm happy they sell Pure Eire milk here. &#160;100% grass fed cows that produce some mighty delicious milk. &#160;I really wish that they would sell raw milk here. &#160;Oh well. &#160;The jalapeno bagel is wonderful! PESTO BREAD.Best invention ever. &#160;My favorite sauce is pesto, with hummus coming to a close second. &#160;Best friend shared some with me one day, and I asked her, 'where did you purchase that?' &#160;That's where it all started. &#160;My mother and I shopped here before, and we both really like it.Definitely my favorite part here is the granola bar. &#160;Granola is a great snack, and it's super crunchy and healthy. &#160;I like to use it as a topping for yogurt, and eat it like cereal with milk. &#160;Delish!Pesto bread is in the form of a dinner roll. &#160;It is covered with green specks, soft, fluffy, and amazing. &#160;I think I could live on that bread alone. &#160;I also like the purchase snacks here. &#160;Including smart puffs, tings, and pirate's booty. &#160; Snackalicious.I miss coming here! &#160;I'll be back for granola and pesto bread. This store will always be my all time favorite place to shop- they have great selection of all things natural. &#160;I no longer live deep in the heart of Seatown, and it makes me sad that I can't shop there regularly- because the staff is always friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. &#160;Pricing is comparable to other co-ops, though in some cases, much better. &#160;The ONLY reason they don't get 5 stars, is that they aren't in Everett, to make my life easier! :) This review is slightly biased as I used to work for this company back in the day. This is my favorite PCC location. Sooo central and essential to Fremont. The deli &amp; bakery are overstocked with yummy delicious and the wine and beer department is top notch.Check out their soups for a light snack. PCC is all about natural foods. It's in their name.The staff is always nice. The selection is really good, especially with the ""niche"" they're working in of natural food. The prepared foods they offer are great. I've had a few of their salads, and I get the pizza regularly. However, the espresso drinks aren't so great. Sorry guys, you're just not pro baristas.I was surprised to find that the prices are not outrageous. Something about this place really makes me feel like the natural food thing isn't just a business plan. It really seems like they care about the foods they sell. Maybe it's just good marketing, but it worked on me. I adore PCC. It's within walking distance for me and I can buy any ingredient needed for whatever I'm making for dinner that night. I visit here for local beef any time I make Pho.The staff is super friendly and helpful too. They usually insist on walking me to whatever I'm looking for.I just wish I had the money to do all of my grocery shopping here. It'd be nice to always eat healthy. I love organic smaller grocery stores like PCC. I've been here several times for lunch to get their fresh food. Here's what I've had:-California potato salad ($6.99/lb) - this was simply ok, the potatoes were undercooked and I didn't like the olives and celery in it-Broccoli waldorf ($7.99/lb) - this was pretty good, though I wish they would chop up the broccoli a little more and cook it more thoroughly-Black bean and corn salad ($6.99/lb) - this was really good, I would highly recommend getting this if you want something light-Veggie pot pie ($5 each) - I had been craving something warm and I hadn't found a veggie pot pie in nearly a decade so I was really excited about this and it was actually really good. I would recommend taking it home and putting it in the oven rather than microwaving it if you have time-Mushroom risotto from the warm foods section ($7.99) - if you are wanting something more filling this is a good option as it was pretty good but was a little priceyThe small baked good section is also not to be missed. They have some killer chocolate chip cookies for only .99 and some tasty chocolate chip walnut scones for $1.99Bottom line, PCC is a great stop whether you're doing full on grocery shopping or just need to grab a bite to eat This PCC is the only one I've experienced and I have to say, it is wonderful shopping here. I came here over the weekened and it made me want to move back to Fremont. I know, I'm sure the ones in West Seattle and Greenlake are great, but the location and surroundings to this one cannot be beat. Items here can be on the ridiculously priced side, but I would only buy certain things here anyways. Their wine section is awesome. Tons of local selections for $12 and under. I've atteneded several of the wine tastings they have in the summer months and it's always a great way to unwind after work!I also have to mention, that their pizza by the slice is pretty good too. We love stopping here during a walk, grabbing a piece and one of the crazy flavored sodas in the beer aisle before consuming it down by the canal watching the boats drift by. The only con I can think of regarding PCC would be some of the snotty hippie types (I know I just contradicted myself, but you know what I'm talking about) that frequent the store. Reviewer 100! PCC is the centerpiece of the Fremont neighborhood. There are no big supermarket chains in the area, except PCC and I think the community likes it that way. I think if someone else came in, the vibe of Fremont would be different.Out of the few PCC locations that I have visited, I have to say this one is my favorite. It is spacious and conveniently located. They have self checkouts! The produce and meat selection is of great quality. So are the deli and baked goods. The pricing is a bit high, which is expected due to the high quality. This is a natural foods place after all.Being the only grocer in the neighborhood, I like that their selection appeals to the masses, but also appeals to the conscientious shopper. For instance, they sell chocolate, but not of the M&amp;Ms variety. Has a similar vibe to Metropolitan Market which focuses on offering quality products with a highlight towards locally produced items.PCC is a great place to shop in Fremont. I can't imagine the community without this place. It is the meeting place of the neighborhood. If Fremont is the center of the universe, PCC is the center of the center of the universe. I'm sure everything else in this grocery store is deliciously organic and farm-grown and harvested by little elves (with a price to match) but I haven't had the time nor inclination to explore other sections of the store besides the beauty section and the heavenly deli.Beauty section: all the natural cosmetics and hair care products that you'd want. You can even buy select shampoos/conditioners/lotions (including jojoba oil, which I hear is something of a miracle-worker) in bulk so you get a discount.Deli: On days when I'm too lazy to pack a lunch, I happily wander over to the PCC deli. It's selections are so vast and delicious that I truly feel that this is the best place to eat lunch in Fremont if you're rolling alone and with a book. Pizza, a rotating daily selection of hot food ($8/lb.), about 5 different soups each day, and salads and pasta galore! The people working behind the deli counter are super nice and happily offer samples of whatever enticing thing you want to try. I, in turn, have happily accepted said samples, only to spurn the sampled food in favor of the DELICIOUSLY CHEESY vegetarian lasagna. Mmmmm. Finish off by grabbing a cookie out of the case for dessert. Hooray! PCC in Fremont is conveniently located a few blocks from the yoga studio I practice at regularly. It's where I always go to get carob, kale mix, and coconut water. Like others have said, everything is on the pricey side, but their selection is a bit wider than other grocery stores. So, I guess it depends on what I am looking for. I love PCC! They do not carry any GMO's. Everything is high quality and has a large variety. Everytime I get to visit PCC, it makes my day. This is definitely my favorite of all the PCC stores, because I really like the layout of the store. &#160;It's a bit bigger than some of the other stores &amp; everything is easy to find. &#160;They almost always have free samples of pizza (yeah!!!) and they have self-check as well as regular check-out registers. &#160;Great location in the heart of Fremont &amp; they have a parking lot.Lots of gluten free foods, great pre-made salads, and tons of deli and bakery foods.Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it's a bit pricey! After I finally made the switch to eating healthy, organic, natural foods, I started shopping for a good, decently affordable natural foods grocery store. &#160;As far as going to a grocery store, my first choice still remains Trader Joe's, as their prices are unbeatable. &#160;Unfortunately, however, TJ's selection is pretty limited, and they don't carry many grass fed, organic meat options. &#160;I made the mistake of shopping at Whole Foods once, and almost broke the bank. &#160;After that I decided it was time to check out PCC. &#160;They're still a little pricier than Trader Joe's, but they have a much larger selection, so I generally split my time between the two stores. &#160;There are so many options for local and organic meat options and produce, it's fantastic! &#160;The staff are extremely helpful and friendly, and it's usually not packed to the walls like TJ's. &#160; &#160;Quick Tip: They have 3 lb bags of frozen berries from Remlinger Farms...Delicious and affordable!"

And while I'm taking classes there and working on my mind and soul, I'm buying food at PCC and taking care of my body.This is a pretty big PCC, and like my own local PCC in Seward Park, it has a huge selection of organic and natural items. The store is clean and bright, and the people are always friendly and helpful.I especially like that this location has the self-checkout stands down on the Deli end of the store. I can run in, grab a couple pieces of fruit, a few ounces of deli turkey, and some veggies, and get back out in time to get back to my class during break.Nothing like a healthy body to compliment a healthy mind. Oh, PCC how I miss you. I had the chance to fall into your open arms the other night, after a year and a half away. I will miss you when I leave to return to my new home, where there isn't anything quite like you. You retain your neighborhood pride while providing the most ridiculous and GreenSmug products, all somehow without seeming snooty. The produce. The beauty section. The samples everywhere- vitamins, cheese, mate tea- I love you, PCC. I'm glad to be a member.It's beautiful, it's clean, it's not overpriced (I live in the Bay area, I know overpriced) and it's lovely. Maybe I feel this way because you were my home grocery store for 10 years, and even after I moved to a different area of the city, I still came to you, Fremont PCC, because I love you so. Maybe you're just that good. I'll always love you, Fremont PCC. Love the Fremont PCC! We go there every couple of weeks as our main grocery stop. The food there is great; very convenient to know that most everything we get there is organic, healthy, free-trade and in many cases produced locally. Really wish there was a location on Capitol Hill so we could go closer to our house, but nonetheless, PCC is absolutely the best choice for food in the Puget Sound area. I received a quite rude staff person yesterday in the meat department. I had a legit &#160;question about if she had any fresh bulk sausage &#160;and I guess she didn't understand my question so I repeated it and cut me off and barged over to show me the wrong thing. I then re stated my question for the third time and she explained that they didn't have any fresh bulk sausage and was like you can just squeeze it out. and so I politely said thank you and she just said uh huh. I expect more from a PCC employee and a parting comment or further assistance. &#160; &#160;the good thing was a came across a very nice employee a few minutes later :D oh my god, if there's any advice i can give about shopping here it's definitely to NOT shop here on an empty stomach!!! Everything in the deli area smells and looks amazing, the organic bread selection is to die for, and they carry awesome local goods like Mighty-O donuts!Take a bike ride on Sunday to the Fremont farmer's market, scope out the cool antique wares, and then grab lunch at PCC! I never imagined that I would fall in love with a grocery store. &#160;But this PCC has stolen my heart.A delicious and expansive selection of organic produce and dairy products. &#160;Employees that seem overjoyed to get the opportunity to help you find what you seek or wash and slice a free piece of fruit for your little girl to snack on while you shop. &#160;A bright, pleasant, and clean ambience. &#160;No bizzarre stories in the news about CEOs who marginalize obese employees or are anti-health care.I have lived a lot of places and never encountered a grocery store that I like as much as this one. Ahhhhh.... I have funny memories of this place. I used to dumpster dive here every night after work one winter! It was pretty awesome when they were in the other location because their dumpsters were in the alley.. so, very easy access. Also, they separate their produce garbage from the other garbage so the good stuff doesn't get mixed in with the nasty. Haven't really visited their dumpster since their move, I like to buy food from inside the store now. Then there was that time my friend has a nervous breakdown in the store. I should probably let her tell that story, though...Sure, it's a natural food co-op. But it's also so much more... it even has a nice clean public restroom. PCC - Fremont is by far the best of all the PCC Markets in Seattle. &#160;Located in a frisky and fun neighborhood, the market has taken on part of the personality of the area and in a positive way. &#160;The produce is always fresh and well cared-for by the mellow and happy staff. &#160;The items are almost always well stocked and the story is kept in top condition, not only looking clean, but smelling so as well. There's such a care put into PCC that you should become a member of this co-op on your first visit. It is a bit more expensive (much like Whole Foods), but lacks the pretentiousness you will find at other natural foods markets. &#160; PCC is my top three markets of all time and I'm grateful I have a lifetime membership. PCC makes Whole Foods look like Wal-Mart. That's how hippie it is.But that's a good thing. The prices can be a bit higher, but you are paying for quality. The produce section is a staple for me, as are the prepared food items like the vegan brownies. I also like to splurge now and then and get one of the take home and bake pizzas. The veggie one is super good!If PCC was a bit more affordable, I'd probably get my groceries from there exclusively. I still get equivalent items like Silk Soymilk from other places and rely on PCC for their unique items. Outstanding customer service to day! It's been exactly 2 years since the lost application debacle. &#160;Nice full circle. I still wish for the days of closer relationships and the huge hope.NOTE-my idea ot label the recycling was acted upon! Pretty awesome place. Prices are insane. This place is great for what it is, an overpriced health store. Its huge for a co-op which is good &amp; bad but thats what the west coast is - alternative living multiplied by suburb to the square-root of money. Its always a treat to go there. I love it. The prepared food is ok - def not as good as whole food. I spend too much money at this place &amp; you should to. The good: great selection of specialty productsThe bad: most of the prices will make you pee your pants.I completely understand that a higher quality product is going to come at a higher price, however, I think they should also provide generic items for those of us who don't require high maintenance items for every little thing. I heart this market. &#160;I wish it was a bit closer to where I live (although that would actually be pretty dangerous). &#160;At first glance, I assumed prices would be on the same page as a Whole Foods. &#160;Not true. &#160;I purchased a bottle of water, a sandwich and a small salad for $7. &#160;Everything is so fresh and tasty. &#160;I love the counter with prepared foods/salads (you can sample anything and everything). &#160; The staff are super friendly and helpful. &#160;I especially love that they recycle everything (even have a compost). &#160;You would never see this at a market back east - people in Seattle are so green - I love it! &#160; PCC is the opposite of a large, stuffy, corporate chain - I'll gladly make the trek to shop here. I've tasted of your bountiful deli. &#160;I've savored on your every olive. &#160;I've sat contented eating your delicious lox. &#160;I've nibbled on your every flavor. &#160;I drank of most every coffee and crumbled most every cookie. &#160;I've sipped of your teas, soaked in your salt and munched on your asparagus. &#160;In &#160;fact, I adore you PCC. &#160; I become you. &#160;One note: &#160;Please tell the people in the deli to keep up the amazing emerald city salad and other fantastic and amazingly delicious foods, but remind them to put the customer back in customer service. &#160;Thanks!"

I mean really, HOW DO I BEGIN A CANONIZATION PROCESS? I KNOW I'M NOT CATHOLIC! I love a Pretzel grinder, I don't care what you put on it. &#160;Oh, except for whatever a ""Smart"" pretzel grinder is in the PCC, I assume that means no meat. That sucks. &#160;With meat? That's a sandwich. &#160;Put mine on a pretzel roll.HARMONICA/GUITAR COMEDY SINGER GUY: If you've been here, you know this guy, the long grey pony tail favored by the most streotypically awful Seattle faux-hippie. &#160;This one has the harmonica setup though I've never seen him play it. &#160;I've almost never seen him play guitar or sing either. &#160;Mostly he does an endless monologue of stupid leftist political material. &#160;No-one going in or out has time to hear much of it, but the people sitting on the little patio are tortured by this idiot for the entire time they sit. &#160;Hey, it's Seattle, I'm sure we all love a Sarah Palin joke but FOR TWO FULL HOURS WHILE WE'RE TRYING TO EAT OUR LUNCH, NO, HEY PONY TAIL GUY, PLAY SOME FUCKING SEGER OR SHUT UP!BEER AISLE: I've never worked this close to a grocery store before, this one has a fantastic selection of microbrew. &#160;Ever have a bad day at the office but 2 minutes after standing up at your desk you are in front of the cooler picking out the six high-alcohol IPAs that are going to foggy up your brain in JUST 30 MINUTES FROM NOW AND LET YOU FORGET SO YOU CAN PEEL YOURSELF OUT OF YOUR WARM BED TOMORROW AND GO BACK TO WORK AND TAKE YOUR BEATING. YET. AGAIN.???? Well I have. &#160;Ferreting that paper bag full of hoppy goodness back to my car at 5:50 p.m. is high point of any number of work days. &#160;I DON'T TAKE MUCH JOY FROM MY WORK. &#160;I'm off topic.SAVE THE CHILDREN: Boy, when you put your head down and pretend like you don't see 'Save the Children' there's a little pang of guilt. &#160;I suspect they know this because they station like 6 of them around in some kind of ambushy manuever they must have learned from confiscated Viet Cong manuals. &#160;Feels like there are hundreds of them! I always mutter something like ""no, thanks"" like the people care about MY RETORT. &#160;The right way must be to just hustle past, right? Like you never even saw the 100 solicitors with the matching T-Shirts and the clipboards??? HOLD OUR CLIPBOARD IN YOUR HANDS BECAUSE ONCE YOU DO THAT YOU WILL HAVE TO GIVE US FIVE DOLLARS OR CHILDREN WILL NOT BE SAVED, NO YOU CANNOT JUST TAKE OUR LITERATURE AND 'THINK ABOUT IT', THINKING TIME IS OVER AND NOW IT IS WALLET TIME OR CLIPBOARD STAYS, LOOK AT ALL THESE PIECES OF PAPER AND OUR T-SHIRTS. MONEY NOW.FOCCACIA SANDWICHES: I think I spelled that wrong but I'm too lazy to look it up. &#160;Note, these must be grilled. &#160;It takes what they claim is 5 minutes but when you're waiting for a sandwich to be grilled it seems like TWO HOURS but anyone who gets them cold belongs in a lunatic asylum. &#160;These are all good. &#160;I had a Turkey and Havarti (melty) with red onions the other day I'm still thinking about. &#160;My standby is the falafel which is kind of sissy and Seattle and DON'T JUDGE ME.BIKE LANE: &#160;This is a one way street but the bike lane technically makes it two lanes. &#160;I walk across that street to get my lunch. &#160;Hey, biker, I don't care if McGinn makes this city BIKE ONLY I DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THIS LANE AS ACTUAL TRAFFIC AND I WILL NOT LOOK BOTH WAYS ONLY THE WAY THE CAR IS COMING AND IF YOU HIT ME I WILL BRING A PHALANX OF ATTORNIES DOWN ON YOU AND BURY YOU AND SIEZE YOUR BIKE AND CUT IT INTO PIECES AND TOSS IT IN MY HOARDER NEIGHBORS YARD. &#160;So don't give me any snippy attidtude when you have to dodge me crossing because I simply don't care. &#160;Get a car. &#160;THIS ISN'T HOLLAND.MEAT: I'm all grass-fed baby. &#160;Michael Pollan's smug ass has a convert here. &#160;PCC gets me my grass-fed steer. &#160;Corn fed can haul. &#160;My Omega 3 count is EXPANDING EXPONENTIALLY. &#160;FEAR MY OMEGA 3 COUNT.WEIRD SUPPLEMENT AISLE: What is all this crap? This is all fraud. &#160;Oh, oh, wait....except for my Omega 3 supplements. &#160;That will eventually make me telepathic and I will live to be a hundred and see hoverboards decimate the bicycle population.CHEESE DEPARTMENT: If you hang out here any longer than three minutes the cheese guy will give you cheese to try. &#160;Not bother you asking you what you're looking for, this cheese guy knows full well I haven't the foggiest what the fuck I'm looking for, he can tell I grew up in Orange County and remain flabbergasted that the swiss cheese with the holes in it is NOT A GOURMET CHEESE! It sure was in my house. &#160;This cheese guys says HEY EAT THIS AND THEN BUY IT DUMMY! &#160;Which I do.Yelp is telling me I'm out of space. &#160;Alas, so much more unsaid ..... you are soo close to my work. and have mostly everything i need! plus your employees are ssooooo freindly. After shopping @ PCC for the past few years (houghton location) I didn't think it could get much better. Since moving to Seattle, my boyfriend &amp; I were looking for grocery store nearby- the closest being whole foods. We decided to make the extra few minutes drive to go this PCC and let me tell you it was WELL worth it! This PCC feels so much better stocked &amp; much larger. The parking was easy free &amp; underground and their produce selection is perfect! Some of the most delicious apples i've ever had :)Note: Being a vegan- rarely do I get the privilege of enjoy pizza and when I do it's usually from Pizza Pi on the Ave. After our long/extensive grocery trip this girl was hungry, so I ventured over to the hot food section &amp; to my surprise found VEGAN PIZZA. It looked.... bleh not that great but I was really hungry and figured i'd try it out. HOLY COW BATMAN! Talk about yummy goodness. It knocked Pizza Pi out of the water &amp; it didn't even have vegan cheese. It was really THAT good, I could go on and on about it. So all in all, this PCC get's my five stars plus ++++ many kudos for their tasty pizza which next time i will buy not by the slice but, the whole damn pizza!! This PCC is not very different from other stores, though it does seem slightly bigger. The selections are great, there's a lot of deli food that is tasty and fresh, and this particular location really has Fremont spelled all over it. It seems better stocked, with a bigger selection of local foods, and has a very nice audience shopping here regularly. Overall, great place to get your groceries if you are a foodie and don't mind spending some extra buck on local/organic/sustainable. This store will always be my all time favorite place to shop- they have great selection of all things natural. &#160;I no longer live deep in the heart of Seatown, and it makes me sad that I can't shop there regularly- because the staff is always friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. &#160;Pricing is comparable to other co-ops, though in some cases, much better. &#160;The ONLY reason they don't get 5 stars, is that they aren't in Everett, to make my life easier! :) I adore PCC. It's within walking distance for me and I can buy any ingredient needed for whatever I'm making for dinner that night. I visit here for local beef any time I make Pho.The staff is super friendly and helpful too. They usually insist on walking me to whatever I'm looking for.I just wish I had the money to do all of my grocery shopping here. It'd be nice to always eat healthy. Reviewer 100! PCC is the centerpiece of the Fremont neighborhood. There are no big supermarket chains in the area, except PCC and I think the community likes it that way. I think if someone else came in, the vibe of Fremont would be different.Out of the few PCC locations that I have visited, I have to say this one is my favorite. It is spacious and conveniently located. They have self checkouts! The produce and meat selection is of great quality. So are the deli and baked goods. The pricing is a bit high, which is expected due to the high quality. This is a natural foods place after all.Being the only grocer in the neighborhood, I like that their selection appeals to the masses, but also appeals to the conscientious shopper. For instance, they sell chocolate, but not of the M&amp;Ms variety. Has a similar vibe to Metropolitan Market which focuses on offering quality products with a highlight towards locally produced items.PCC is a great place to shop in Fremont. I can't imagine the community without this place. It is the meeting place of the neighborhood. If Fremont is the center of the universe, PCC is the center of the center of the universe. I'm sure everything else in this grocery store is deliciously organic and farm-grown and harvested by little elves (with a price to match) but I haven't had the time nor inclination to explore other sections of the store besides the beauty section and the heavenly deli.Beauty section: all the natural cosmetics and hair care products that you'd want. You can even buy select shampoos/conditioners/lotions (including jojoba oil, which I hear is something of a miracle-worker) in bulk so you get a discount.Deli: On days when I'm too lazy to pack a lunch, I happily wander over to the PCC deli. It's selections are so vast and delicious that I truly feel that this is the best place to eat lunch in Fremont if you're rolling alone and with a book. Pizza, a rotating daily selection of hot food ($8/lb.), about 5 different soups each day, and salads and pasta galore! The people working behind the deli counter are super nice and happily offer samples of whatever enticing thing you want to try. I, in turn, have happily accepted said samples, only to spurn the sampled food in favor of the DELICIOUSLY CHEESY vegetarian lasagna. Mmmmm. Finish off by grabbing a cookie out of the case for dessert. Hooray! This is definitely my favorite of all the PCC stores, because I really like the layout of the store. &#160;It's a bit bigger than some of the other stores &amp; everything is easy to find. &#160;They almost always have free samples of pizza (yeah!!!) and they have self-check as well as regular check-out registers. &#160;Great location in the heart of Fremont &amp; they have a parking lot.Lots of gluten free foods, great pre-made salads, and tons of deli and bakery foods.Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it's a bit pricey!"

Diet and exercise; alteration of what I'm doing career wise, taking control of finances, and most importantly working on the way I think about myself and the world around me.This has wound up putting me over at Landmark Education almost weekly for the last six months, right here in Fremont. And while I'm taking classes there and working on my mind and soul, I'm buying food at PCC and taking care of my body.This is a pretty big PCC, and like my own local PCC in Seward Park, it has a huge selection of organic and natural items. The store is clean and bright, and the people are always friendly and helpful.I especially like that this location has the self-checkout stands down on the Deli end of the store. I can run in, grab a couple pieces of fruit, a few ounces of deli turkey, and some veggies, and get back out in time to get back to my class during break.Nothing like a healthy body to compliment a healthy mind. Oh, PCC how I miss you. I had the chance to fall into your open arms the other night, after a year and a half away. I will miss you when I leave to return to my new home, where there isn't anything quite like you. You retain your neighborhood pride while providing the most ridiculous and GreenSmug products, all somehow without seeming snooty. The produce. The beauty section. The samples everywhere- vitamins, cheese, mate tea- I love you, PCC. I'm glad to be a member.It's beautiful, it's clean, it's not overpriced (I live in the Bay area, I know overpriced) and it's lovely.

The dangers of living right above this place! The smell of the pizza baking late night is especially dangerous. The prices are ridiculously outrageous, the produce variety is out of this world and fresh, the prepared foods are relatively healthy AND tasty. I only allow myself to go in for the last minute items I need for dinner THAT day and save my weekly trips for Trader Joe's, and the farmer's markets, otherwise, I'd need a second job! ps they have wine tastings on Thursdays. The produce at PCC is fantastic. I asked the produce guy (joe) to help me pick out a watermelon (I know, but I'm so bad at it) one night at midnight and he was friendly and helpful, not only picking one out for me, but also giving me a lesson. PCC is reliably fresh and offers a great selection of Prosecco and chocolates. Of course, it's also reliably more expensive, but you pay for the quality, selection, local specialties, and organic everything. I believe in PCC. If I lived in Fremont, I would probably go broke because of this place. &#160;Unlike the View Ridge PCC, this one is huge and well-stocked. &#160;The produce looked fresher, too. &#160;I stopped by today and had a delicious prosciutto and mozzarella sandwich. &#160;I also picked up a bottle of wine that was a surprisingly good deal.For high-quality specialty products with a hefty pricetag overall, this is the place to go. oh my god, if there's any advice i can give about shopping here it's definitely to NOT shop here on an empty stomach!!!

PESTO BREAD.Best invention ever. &#160;My favorite sauce is pesto, with hummus coming to a close second. &#160;Best friend shared some with me one day, and I asked her, 'where did you purchase that?' &#160;That's where it all started. &#160;My mother and I shopped here before, and we both really like it.Definitely my favorite part here is the granola bar. &#160;Granola is a great snack, and it's super crunchy and healthy. &#160;I like to use it as a topping for yogurt, and eat it like cereal with milk. &#160;Delish!Pesto bread is in the form of a dinner roll. &#160;It is covered with green specks, soft, fluffy, and amazing. &#160;I think I could live on that bread alone. &#160;I also like the purchase snacks here. &#160;Including smart puffs, tings, and pirate's booty. &#160; Snackalicious.I miss coming here! &#160;I'll be back for granola and pesto bread. Outstanding customer service to day! It's been exactly 2 years since the lost application debacle. &#160;Nice full circle. I still wish for the days of closer relationships and the huge hope.NOTE-my idea ot label the recycling was acted upon! This review is slightly biased as I used to work for this company back in the day. This is my favorite PCC location. Sooo central and essential to Fremont. The deli &amp; bakery are overstocked with yummy delicious and the wine and beer department is top notch.Check out their soups for a light snack. Pretty awesome place. Prices are insane. This place is great for what it is, an overpriced health store. Its huge for a co-op which is good &amp; bad but thats what the west coast is - alternative living multiplied by suburb to the square-root of money. Its always a treat to go there. I love it. The prepared food is ok - def not as good as whole food. I spend too much money at this place &amp; you should to. The good: great selection of specialty productsThe bad: most of the prices will make you pee your pants.I completely understand that a higher quality product is going to come at a higher price, however, I think they should also provide generic items for those of us who don't require high maintenance items for every little thing. I love organic smaller grocery stores like PCC. I've been here several times for lunch to get their fresh food. Here's what I've had:-California potato salad ($6.99/lb) - this was simply ok, the potatoes were undercooked and I didn't like the olives and celery in it-Broccoli waldorf ($7.99/lb) - this was pretty good, though I wish they would chop up the broccoli a little more and cook it more thoroughly-Black bean and corn salad ($6.99/lb) - this was really good, I would highly recommend getting this if you want something light-Veggie pot pie ($5 each) - I had been craving something warm and I hadn't found a veggie pot pie in nearly a decade so I was really excited about this and it was actually really good. I would recommend taking it home and putting it in the oven rather than microwaving it if you have time-Mushroom risotto from the warm foods section ($7.99) - if you are wanting something more filling this is a good option as it was pretty good but was a little priceyThe small baked good section is also not to be missed. They have some killer chocolate chip cookies for only .99 and some tasty chocolate chip walnut scones for $1.99Bottom line, PCC is a great stop whether you're doing full on grocery shopping or just need to grab a bite to eat I heart this market. &#160;I wish it was a bit closer to where I live (although that would actually be pretty dangerous). &#160;At first glance, I assumed prices would be on the same page as a Whole Foods. &#160;Not true. &#160;I purchased a bottle of water, a sandwich and a small salad for $7. &#160;Everything is so fresh and tasty. &#160;I love the counter with prepared foods/salads (you can sample anything and everything). &#160; The staff are super friendly and helpful. &#160;I especially love that they recycle everything (even have a compost). &#160;You would never see this at a market back east - people in Seattle are so green - I love it! &#160; PCC is the opposite of a large, stuffy, corporate chain - I'll gladly make the trek to shop here.

My mom used to share a co-op membership with her friend back in the day, when PCC was just a little granola outpost in a wasteland of crappy corporate grocery stores. But that was many moons ago.Nowadays PCC operates a simply AMAZING store in Fremont that makes me jealous of everyone living within spitting distance. Fresh, organic produce. Whole, healthy, unprocessed foods. Niche, natural ingredients and supplements. An incredible deli with hot food, cold food, soups, coffee, and some incredibly good pizza. This is like a mecca for schizophrenic eaters like me who want a little of everything. It's all here.The majority of my shopping here is from the deli section, and it never disappoints. Whether it's a hot breakfast of eggs and potatoes, a nice cold deli salad, a pre-made sandwich, a cup of soup, or whatever, I know that only quality ingredients are in use, and I am never let down by the flavor. Overall, this comes close to my perfect grocery store, and easily rivals New Seasons in Portland. Everything is done with a conscious pride in quality, sustainability, and humanity, and it's all packaged up and sold to me at prices no greater than your average gourmet store. The service is knowledgeable and friendly. If I lived near here I would not shop anywhere else for produce, deli, and natural foods. I may not be a member of the co-op any more, but I am a fan for life. I love this place, great bulk food section, cheese selection is decent for a grocery store, good wine selection and great bread -- I mean when you can get good wine, cheese and bread do you really need anything else... BACON - they have Hemplers, which makes Saturday breakfast so yummy. I try to get to the Thursday wine tastings when I can, $5 for tasting and munchies. And don't even get me started on the 7 layer cookies. Plus, it's a block from work and within a short walk from the house... well that just makes the shop perfect. My FAVORITE grocery store ever! &#160;Seriously, I sometimes go hang out here when I need a little pick me up. PCC is a bit too expensive for me to do my regular shopping at, but I come here often for the convenience of their deli foods. I love the vegan sandwiches, cookies and cupcakes. &#160;I'm pretty sure that Robert Pattinson's twin brother works here which is a plus in my book. I really love the vegan pizza by the slice. &#160;It's a little spicy and has a great pesto flavor. &#160;I have not had such good luck with the other prepared foods (why does every place in seattle have to try putting falafel on panini/focaccia? &#160;Stick with pita)I like to buy groceries here, but only buy the things that i can't get somewhere else...yes, it's expensive, but you pay for quality. Their vegan hawaiian cookie with papaya and coconut is awesome. the dark chocolate one isn't as good. i enjoy that they have the pizza by the slice and features similar to whole foods markets. Definitely a great grocery store (and a great PCC). It's got some nice outdoor seating that's great for people watching during the Fremont Sunday Market. The deli has some really good stuff and I was really happy with their soups and sandwiches. The prices are reasonable for the quality. Best of all, the place is very well lit and comfortable and has a great community bulletin board across from the clean bathrooms. I've just discovered this place and it is frick'n awesome. &#160;I came in with some friends to get a pizza and the pizza totally recommended the best topping and then let us add a couple that we couldn't leave off. Staff is no nice and friendly. &#160;Heck, even the people that shop there are nice and friendly. I'll know I have arrived when I can do my entire grocery run at PCC. &#160;Until then, I splurge and stop in for the farm fresh, local produce/seafood of the season. &#160;Yes, it's expensive. &#160;But that's relative if you think of the quality, taste, and supporting our local farmers. So the Safeway up the street has California peaches for 97 cents a pound. &#160;It doesn't smell peachy, and 3 out of the 5 I bought were mushy throwaways. &#160;I shrug it off since, well, I only paid 97 cents/pound. &#160;No biggie. &#160;Don't cheat yourself, and go cheap with a less than mediocre product. &#160;It's never satisfying.PCC delivers juicy, fragrant, Yakima peaches, big n beautiful organic blueberries from Mt. Vernon, and watermelon sun bathed in Wenatchee. &#160;If that doesn't make you bail on your grocery chain, then how about wild Sockeye Salmon? &#160;Fresh, not previously frozen and thawed and then flash frozen salsa shuffle. &#160;It looks and tastes real. &#160;Real damn good.The big chain supermarkets will always serve a purpose, but it's like trail mix on sale. &#160;It sounds like a good deal, a healthy alternative snack. &#160;You know what happens?? &#160;I end up picking out the yogurt covered raisins and M&amp;Ms. &#160;My leftovers end up being stale granola and rock hard cubes of dates. &#160;So, don't skimp on the important stuff, you deserve better! It's convenient to me so I stop in often. The staff is always friendly and helpful and on the weekends there is always a good spread of things to sample.As with most people, my main complaint is the prices and I really don't see how many people can afford to shop here on a regular basis. My big splurge is the $3.29 bottle of Kombucha.My favorites parts are:* Free samples* Bulk granola and nuts* Bulk SpicesThe hot food bar is OK and I have mixed reviews. Often when I stop in it seems like it has been sitting there a while and everything looks a bit crusty. I have had a few of the refrigerated prepared foods and they were pretty decent."

It was one of the tastiest beverages (aside form the Aquavit at Vessel) that I've had in quite some time and I've had this drink elsewhere. None of the others quite measured up.Aside from the coffee, or lack there of, I've always been a fan of their soups, their oatmeal, their salads, their COOKIES, and their roasted yam and artichoke salad (to die for). Their thai steak salad is perfectly spicy and their hot food selection is always decent.Recently, they've added self check out stations where the 'express line' (which was never very quick at lunch time) once was. Good call, I think. It was always chaotic with their two lines, but not really two lines. If you've been in for lunch, you know what I'm talking about.Anywho, when I'm in the area and I need a steamer *snickers*, I'll definitely be getting them from the folks at PCC from now on....There's just something about their steamers *ha* that keep me comin' back for more......I mean, who doesn't love a good steamer? ...Okay, I'm done. PCC? what do these letters stand for? &#160;Perfect Combination of Cheese? Place of Cool, Come on? Please don't Come in here Carnivores? Though I am not certain what the letters stand for, it is certain that their pizza is quite tasty. &#160;You can taste the quality of the cheese, sauce and toppings! I'm not so sure if i'll actually buy any other grocery... since... you know... i'm not really a hippie... i'm sure i'll come here often for their pizza. &#160;BUT i will warn you... DO NOT TRY THEIR CAULIFLOWER CURRY!!!!!! it is one of the most foul things i have ever tasted! (and that includes eating beetle when i was in korea.) seriously. yuck. *Review of the pizza from their deli*So this must be what a natural pizza taste like. You can tell that only the freshest ingredients were used. Best of all, after two slices you didn't feel too bad. The price is a bit steep, $3 a slice, but it is a good idea to treat yourself every once in awhile.Zipzap Zubidy Bop! The best PCC there is! Outdoor seating, low enough prices, hippie-dippie food, the option of self check-out, a deli...puts all other PCCs completely to shame. LOVE &#160;going here for lunch... Its always tasty, fresh food... The only reason I gave it 3 stars and not 4 is that the price is considerably high for a typical pre-made sandwich or cup of soup. If price point isnt an issue for you, definitely swing in for lunch or a no-hassle dinner sometime. I prefer their self serve and deli area whiche is awesome. Perfect for lunch! There soup is always tasty. They have awesome pizza, delicious sandwhiches, and amazing cookies. Personal recommendation - the wheat free chocolate chip cookie. I don't have a gluten intolerance, but I eat them anyways because they are just that good. Fremont is like Whole Foods but with more integrity -- for example, they try to offer a wide array of fresh produce that is actually grown locally. I still love the store, but now know to avoid the ""falafel panini"" in the deli section. It was bland and very bready and just... not that good. The only things working for it was that it only cost about $3.40 and that I was super hungry and almost didn't care what it tasted like. Whoever planned the ""product placement"" in the self check-out area is devious. They have us waiting next to a shopping cart filled with discontinued wines (on sale) and also a variety of small chocolates to choose from. I grabbed some lemony chocolate (by Jo's Candies) and it was quite good. The staff were helpful and around, which was pretty important. One of the self check-out machines kept needing ""assistance"" because it would ""sense"" some mysterious item on it after it printed your receipt (happened to me and the people who used it before me), so the staff kept having to scan their id's and clear the screen. Spendy? Yes! &#160;Fabulous? &#160;You BETCHA!! &#160; &#160;Organic food is my herion and lucky for me, &#160;I work less than a city block away from my crack deala!!! &#160;Oh Sweet organically(?) grown $2 (each) apples! &#160;For breakfast, from the hot food bar, I get: Tofu scramble and two sausage links or Ham depending and a Gingerberry Kombucha(drool)...that's right!! &#160;PCC doesn't judge. &#160;My vegan cashier doesn't give half a poo about the fact that I'm about to ingest a thick, juicy 'Natural County Beef ' burger. &#160;He still asks about my day AND does the Friday count down with me. &#160; Shop here! &#160;They even painted the place with some non toxic water based hippie paint. &#160;It's for the CHILDREN!! I love PCC. &#160;Since I work in Fremont I eat here often.I don't know what I would do without it! &#160;I love grabbing some brown rice and soup for lunch. Or the brown rice sushi they carry. I love that they always have something yummy to eat that isn't poisonous. &#160;The staff is friendly and helpful. &#160;I wish they'd add one in Everett! I really like this PCC over all the other locations, maybe because its in the coolest neighborhood in the land, or maybe its near Peet's, or maybe its because the layout inside is short and to the point. &#160;I would rather go here over Whole Foods personally since I am supporting a local co-op rather than a nationwide chain (although if I want to be more local, I can always go to Madison Market as well). &#160;I also get to use my Puget Sound Community Card, which offers a better discount. &#160; I also see more organic, locally made, fair trade products in PCC. &#160;Only taking off one star since there is not one in Capitol Hill &#160;): Made a stop here during the little cold snap and got me a chicken pesto sandwich. First, I asked for no cheese, and the girl at the deli took it off before she weighed it so I didn't have to pay for it! Then she offered to heat it up for me, which I didn't even know was an option. It was PERFECT since I was cold and hungry. Lastly, it was DELICIOUS. Really, really good, I want another one!! And this is why I keep coming back to PCC even though it certainly doesn't help me stay within my budget. I wanna try the coffee at some point too... &#160;Skip the pizza though, I've had better frozen pizza!! I really like the idea of having such wonderful food at my disposal, heck that is what got me to walk through the door in the first place. What I wasn't ready for was the price of all of that healthy stuff.My god man! If that's what it takes to be healthy then I guess i'm ok with eating all of the chemicals that were told are so bad for us. I would rate PCC as overpriced and overrated (why go there if you can go to Trader Joe's?) with two glaring exceptions: the deli and the beer selection. The hummus is great, the babaganouj is the stuff of dreams, the 22oz bottles available are local, well varied, and often on sale. &#160;These things alone are worth me making the trip over from Wallingford. Now that I live in Fremont, I can properly review PCC since I shop here at least weekly. The staff is helpful and usually in a friendly mood. They just got brand new self-check out stations, I think there are 5, and its fun to do, but be patient, we are all still learning the quircks, including the staff. If you have coupons or something odd, go to the checker line and save a little trouble and time for everyone (not like I did today...oops!).I still like the bakery and the deli, the fish is pretty good although I still wish there was a little more space so they could fancy up their seafood area like Whole Foods does. I bought a Chinook book and they got some nice coupons in em. I often still go to Whole Foods to get my meat/seafood/poultry cuz its fresher and I can pick it and have em weigh exactly what I want and wrap it and send me on my way as opposed to being stuck with whatevers in the case at PCC - and possibly having to make them unwrap, resize, and rewrap.PCC is also excellent at special orders, they actually call you back if no one can help you right away. Nice! They have a hot food bar now with breakfast stuff in the am and lunch/dinner stuff the rest of the day. Most of the time it is fresh, although they should stir some of it once in a while just for kicks n giggles (ok, and the appetizing factor).I have to also say that most of the time when I go, a guy named Kjell helps me who is absolutely sweet and helpful, good sense of humor and cute to boot! Other staff might want to smile as often as he does. Customers like it. Price not nice.I work in the neighborhood and visit at least twice a week. Their deli is great, meaning, I'm pleased to say, that it's improving a lot. The staff had a recent turnover, and the current crew is really nice.What's not nice, not nice at all, are the prices. The store is arranged with the deli on the east side and the product on the west. Everything between is a ""holy shit, you're kidding me"" priced disappointment. Let's say you're there to buy Triscuits and hummus. At any store on earth, you'd leave spending somewhere around $4.50. At PCC, the Triscuits are actually something hokey like ""Organic Amaranth Revitalizing Squares"", and cost $5 for a box. Then, the hummus is another zillion dollars. I'm not mad at them for having only hippie food, but a recent trip to Madison Market on Capitol Hill proved to me that PCC is jacking up prices for nothing. If you were ask PCCers why their food is so expensive, you'd get the typical platitude about not being able to buy in bulk, only having quality products, and how they pay their employees more than supermarkets. If that's true, why does Madison Market crrrrrush them in every department? Bottom Line: Unless you're geographically challenged, expand your horizons on groceries. There are numerous stores scattered around Seattle that do much better than PCC. PCC is one of my favorite places to go grocery shopping, or to go for a quick bite. With all of the ingredients to all of their pre-made food clearly labeled, it is food heaven for an food allergy freak such as myself. From the delicious baked goods to the always delicious (and often creative) soup bar this place is top of the list for urban grocery shopping for me. I frequent PCC pretty often as I live right up the hill. &#160;I stopped doing my regular grocery shopping here because it was just rediculously expensive, so now I make the mile trek to Fred Meyer. &#160;I still come here late night for a snack or wine or beer and if I need a quick dinner I will grab one of their already made salads which are amazing. &#160;I like that everything is local and mostly organic but if you have any kind of budget, this isn't the place for you. PCC is a beautiful store with lovely produce, healthy take-out and a delicious prepared foods department. Although they don't have a big selection of fish and meats, you can be assured they'll be safe to eat. They also have loads of self-serve bins filled with nuts, grains, pasta and snacks. And their assortment of cheeses is very nice too. For a relatively small market, it packs a lot into a little space.I especially like this PCC for it's outdoor eating area. It's generally sunny when the weather cooperates. Plus, it has some decent people-watching; not as interesting as NY or Paris, but hey, I'll take it.So if you're hungry grab some quick drinks and take-out from their wide selection of hot and cold foods. Or just grab a coffee and snack from the bar. From vegan to carnivore, this store delivers. (3.5 Stars) I'm a Whole Foods shopper, so the prices here on some items almost seem reasonable, although certainly higher than Safeway, QFC, etc.Why I love this location: &#160;I try very hard to buy local and organic - I don't have to do much label / sign reading when I'm picking out produce and/or everything else here. &#160;They have a pretty large selection of fruits and vegetables, and I really like that there are some herbs you can actually get in bunches instead of the mini-plastic packs. &#160;The bulk items section is somewhat small, but has a good ""normal"" stock and they offer reusable containers instead of the normal plastic bag solution.On the neutral side of things, I'm often stumped over the location of items here - often incoherent. &#160;For instance, why isn't the fresh baked bread with the packaged bread? &#160;Why isn't the cr&#232;me fra&#238;che with the sour cream - in fact, where exactly are you hiding it? &#160;I have better things to do than push my cart up and down the isles looking for things.Why I hate this location: &#160;I have never been able to get all my shopping list completely filled here; always caps out at the 75% mark and I find I have to go elsewhere for the rest. &#160;As 99.9% of the time I can fill my entire list at Whole Foods, it can make going out of my way to this location difficult to justify. &#160;Question to PCC: Why do you even bother with the meat section? &#160;This one is better than the Green Lake location, but they all suck. I know that it's local and that's great, but it's also really expensive and has very limited selection. &#160;The produce is very nice, but unlike Whole Foods, they often only offer organics (no conventional alternative if the bell peppers are 7.99/lb). &#160;And when I went there looking for some yeast to make pizza, the only option was a whole big 50 serving packet of yeast. &#160;Umm, I'm not running a bakery. &#160;And I usually opt for the non organic but hormone free milk, because I don't like the taste of Horizon and Organic Valley (my favorite in the NE) has these gross lumps in it atleast 70% of the time (in the NW). &#160;?I would estimate my groceries are about 20% more here than the same items at Whole Foods, and though the profits may go to Texas, many of the producers are also local. &#160;Plus I have about as much loyalty to the NW as I do Texas, well maybe a little more. &#160;They do have some really great unique items - their prepared salads and marinated tofus are usually delicious. &#160;And they have a great, if small cheese and olive selection. &#160;And they do have a good wine selection - if I'm headed to a party I'm pretty confident that whatever I pick up here will be more than drinkable. &#160;I do wish they sold more varieties of freshly baked bread. I have to give this place one more star. &#160;1/2-star for the cute boys walking around, and another 1/2-star for value. &#160;I just purchased a meaty-turkey, cream-cheese wrap for $2.89. &#160;With a drink it came to roughly $4.00. &#160;PCC in three words, healthy, delicious, cheap. &#160;Cheers! I love to haunt the PCC deli in Fremont.Highlights:The delicious chocolate rugelach. &#160;Pastries like pies and croissants don't normally do it for me, but this was chocolate confection rolled in a thin flaky buttery crust. &#160;It was a little like a chocolate croissant (where you know the chocolate is the best part and you just have to get through the croissant) without much of a croissant.The best carrot cake: I'm not a fan of carrot cake in general, but I picked up a giant slice from the deli for $2.75. &#160;It has a delicious cream cheese icing that I could eat by the spoonful, but the cake itself was really moist and on the dense side. &#160;The flavor was not too carroty or spicy, which is the way I like my carrot cake. &#160;This square slice is probably enough for 4 people, so I am ashamed to say that I ate the whole thing in a day. &#160;I had a crazy sugar headache afterward, so I was duly punished.Green and Black's chocolate ice cream: It's a dark chocolate ice cream that has a great chew to it - I'm a big fan of chewy textured ice creams. &#160;I've heard that the ""chew"" to this ice cream comes from them actually adding real chocolate to it (cocoa butter and all) instead of just cocoa powder. &#160;You can definitely taste the bittersweet chocolate, and it's slow to melt in your mouth, and never really creams or foams up on your tongue the way some ice cream does.Ciao Bella's matcha and white chocolate ice cream: like heaven in my mouth. &#160;Most matcha ice creams taste too bland and creamy to me, like a sweet cream base with a mild infusion of matcha, but this gelato had a smooth, rich texture and strong flavor. A fantastic blend of the bitter matcha and the sweet white chocolate chunks. The best commercial matcha ice cream I've ever had, and it's a gelato."

Walking by the other night I noticed a lot of people tend to buy their dinner and sit in the little cafe they have. I also saw that once in awhile they host wine tasting events. Which leads me to my other favorite thing about PCC - their wine guy. He pops out of no where - and has the greatest suggestions. And seriously he just pops out of no where! Great place to go if you just need to pick up some things, I don't do all my shopping there - too expensive for me - but I still love it! I wander here sometimes at night. It seems others do to- even eating their dinners here or meeting up with people. People watching is amazing in the Center of the Universe. I don't grocery shop here, just like Michelle B., but use it as a resource. You heard me a resource! When my beloved Mighty-O is closed- I can get their numminess here. When I am craving a raw food- I get it here. When I want to grab a huge bottle of local microbrew- with obscure names like Lazy Boy and Arrogant Bastard- I get it at PCC. And when I wanted to try a box of Annie's Whole Wheat Shell Pasta, that I read about in a food bog, I went to Fremont PCC. Things I like- *Delightful and educational (hehe) cheese samples at dinnertime that somehow I never remember they have.*The faces of the checkers when we chat (they are the nicest in the area and don't judge my donut habit) and they find out I am a teacher at a HS and not 18.*The stock of baked and premade items from anywhere and everywhere in the Seattle area and also from the store its self. I won't go there again factors- * Parking is a challenge- especially since I always forget that people go to the Red Door on Fridays and Saturday and take all the parking. I just discovered the parking garage though... I am that slow at this whole urban living thing.*Prices can be ridiculous.* When I need something specialty and it is not a ""organic"" or ""green"" item they don't have it. This review is solely for the Vegetarian Caesar Salad dressing, made in house and the most delectable nectar I've ever encountered. I've gotten my entire family to eat sturdy greens like kale, mustard and chard -- all thanks to this amazing salad dressing. I want to eat it every single night. Thank you, PCC!"

I thought the Whole Foods-ers in San Francisco were out of their minds but whoa...we've got nothing on this store. I have seen some crazy shit at the Whole Foods Cheese Counters and Hot Food Bars but it didn't come close to the collection of kooks, nuts, and apparent paranoids at the PCC. Perhaps PCC should be renamed PCP. Because it seemed likely an awful lot of the patrons had indulged at some point in their lives. I got sneered at, leered at, and ran away from. Since when is a clean girl with a basket of organic food something to fear? In addition to the free circus side show, there's an amazing selection of quality natural products and foods. The staff was polite and extremely helpful. The bulk candy selection was just so-so (minus one whole star for no chocolate peanuts) but their selection of natural travel-size hygiene products was pretty impressive. The store itself is delightful to shop in: clean, well-organized, and easy to navigate.PCC is just one more thing I wish I could have brought back to SF with me. Hey PCC bigwigs: &#160;we have enough crazies in SF to populate many, many stores. Take that into consideration when you're looking to expand... This is a very nice grocery store. Trust me. I work in one.Love the gorgeous organic produce, all labeled with it's origin, sometimes farm name, too. Love the beautiful locally raised grassfed meats. Fairly priced. Hooray!Got some great stuff- didn't break the bank.Happiness achieved for this gal. Let me count the ways I love this grocery store... first, I am so happy they moved the Fremont store to this bright location with more parking and more space inside. &#160;Love that I can buy anything in the store and not have to read the label for HFCS and trans-fat and all the other junk in commercial store-bought foods. &#160;I have food allergies and am so lucky to live in a town where I can buy things that are vegan or egg-free or whatever in abundance. &#160;Love that they source locally and organically and that I can feel good about what I buy here. &#160;Love their deli- I didn't realize I LOVE brussel sprouts until I had them roasted from the PCC deli (try them- you will be surprised!). &#160;I like the PCC deli better than the Whole Foods Deli by a longshot (try the Indonesian rice salad, the veggie samosas, the spicy chicken thighs with no bones). &#160;It's clean here, it's a pretty shopping experience and it makes me happy! Anyone who doesn't give this pcc at least 4 stars is waaay off base in my book. Yeah the yuppie ""look how cool I am cause I only feed my waldorf kid organic"" shoppers are annoying and as usual in my way, but no more so than trader joes.I feel like pcc should get 4 stars just for their ALL organic produce dept. (That's right whole foods! You loose!) The delicate nectarine aroma pulled me over to the stone fruits and I sucked it up and paid 3.99 a lb for peaches and nectarines.Decent selection and because its a co op (kinda) they actually care about getting stuff in for you. I actually worked at the deli here for a few days before they anounced to me that I would have to cut meat as part of my job... that's not gonna happen.They have a great health care plan and treat employees well... downside is you HAVE to join the union. Ick.Anyway shop here, its good. Only complaint is stop selling meat. Eww. You used to be an all vegetarian co op. This PCC has the best looking staff and the best magazine rack for some reason.Their fruit selection is crappy, and the store layout is really poorly designed. It proves to create much congestion and confusion. But the checkers are... ahhh... :)"

I am not sure if I can give an accurate review of the place as I didn't feel very well that day and did not eat much at all for our dim sum lunch. The restaurant is nice inside with the new dark tables and chairs which makes it feel more elegant. The place was quite busy during lunch time and the carts came around pretty frequently. Service was a little slow at the end when we had to have our waiter total up our bill and pack up our leftovers.The four dim sum items we got were your standard items like siu mai and har gow, but I enjoyed the congee the most since I was not up to eating much and was easy to digest. I would definitely come again to try some of their other dim sum items and give a more thorough review. Best Chinese restaurant this side of the ghetto!Hot daym, they done and got a remodel.Family dinners, combos, for around fifteen dolla a person, good laawd that a lot of money, but hella portions.Tru dat they cleaner now, not tryin to have no hair up in mah chow mein.Chicken feet, chow mein, fried rice, honey walnut prawns, Mongolian beef, is what I like errtime I go get my Chinese food on and HKS made it good.But seriously, when you arrive make sure your vehicle is secured and valuables not seen in the car. &#160;During my last visit I wasn't surprised to see some broken car glass on the parking lot ground.Recommended. This is our new go-to dim sum restaurant in South Seattle. &#160;We arrived around noon on Sunday and though the restaurant was nearly filled, we were promptly seated. &#160;Service was warm and affable. &#160;We especially liked their efficient management of our special requests. &#160;Comfortable ambience.Dishes were well prepared. &#160; In particular, we loved the congee and sticky rice. &#160;What we enjoyed the most was their steamed bun filled with sweet vanilla egg custard. &#160;Served hot, damn, these were so good! &#160;We couldn't help ourselves and ordered a second round. &#160;You gotta try 'em.Plenty off-street parking. The owner here is from Hong Kong Restaurant in CT! Glamorously tasty.I forgot when was the last time we went here, but I miss this place. The service is extremely friendly and caring. Everyone who comes here are enlightened with cheerful convos and the food is freshly served hot and pleasant to the eye. I enjoy every dish! If I were to complain about this restaurant it would be the crammed up chairs. You have to tell your neighbor to excuse yourself. We had a family reunion lunch here. &#160; There was a bit of confusion when we got here, but we all got seated. &#160;The food was good. &#160;The food carts kept on coming. &#160;We took some group pictures here and the staff was accommodating, helping us take our pictures.We were here about 2 years ago, with at slightly larger family gathering and we had the same good experience. The quality of the dim sum at this location for the most part has always been reliable. When I am ever in need of a dim sum fix, this is my go to place. You can always count on them having a large variety of food, unlike other places. The best time to come is as close to noon as possible. Any time before that you will be waiting for the dishes to come out, and any time after that the dishes will be cold. If you time it just right though, the food is amazing. My favorite would have to be the fried shrimp balls. I would definitely recommend this Restaurant to anyone that is trying dim sum for the first time. I know most people come here for dim sum but the only time I've been here is usually for a party where we usually get the gazillion course meal. It starts off with an appetizer dish with some cured meat, then a shrimp dish that is very tasty, then several other seafood dishes. My favorite is the steamed whole fish. It is damn good, to the point that I contemplate every time not sharing with the other people at my table. I always justify it as there is so much food on the table already so I will just position this fish dish directly in front of me. Next thing you know the fish is pretty much all gone ""mysteriously"" hehehe. That's ok since they also have this other AMAZING crab dish which looks more enticing then everything else. It is the show stopper, especially since there is a lobster tail with it. It is coated with some kind of garlic sauce that makes you want to lick every claw, just watch out for the sharp parts, ouch! So if you have some type of occasion and you want a gazillion course meal which is usually the best way to get people together, come here. My family and I have been going here for years. I love this place; the food is delicious. If you're looking for a Chinese food fix, try this place out. Try the shoo-mai, deep friend shrimp balls, shrimp salad, general tso chicken, chicken or beef broccoli, walnut prawns, fried rice, chow mein, friend chicken...the list goes on people. So my friend Jeremy and family own this place but I wanted to write a review to express my experience here. &#160;This is the only place we go for dim sum. &#160;I am a shumai fanatic and end up getting about 5 orders to myself. &#160;The chicken feet and honey walnut type shrimp thingy is excellent! &#160;When we are craving dim sum we bring our friends here and all leave happy and full. &#160;If you have not been here try it and look for Jeremy if he is working the place is superb! This is one of my favorite place for dim-sum. The owner is extremely friendly and staff provides excellent customer service. &#160;If you like bitter-melon stuff with shrimp/scallop then you'll definitely like it here. Pretty good place for a morning brunch. =) Love it!"

We certainly need businesses in the Rainier Beach area!GREAT GREAT GREAT friendly service. I really found the owner to be so helpful, friendly, and gracious! &#160;I WILL BE BACK because that is enough in its own.This place is HUGE! If you want Chinese and a large space for your party, this is the place!Dim Sum and traditional dishes are served. &#160;This time, I tried take away for some traditional dishes. &#160;The Chinese mushrooms and steamed veggies of bok choy was fresh and tasted nice. &#160;Almond Fried Chicken was more like deep friend chicken coated fully in batter than the typical sliced chicken with slight breading, so I will not order that again. General Tso chicken sauce was not to my tasting, not bad, just too tangy versus that spicy sweet I crave.I saw on the menu there is roasted duck, which the owner, said to please call ahead with many hours in advance because it takes a lot of time to debone and prepare... that will be next on my dining experience! I love this place! I love that it's located a few minutes from home. The dim sum here's delicious and the service is great too.I will definitely keep coming for as long as I am in the area and I definitely recommend this restaurant. I've been going to this place since I was younger, but I must say that I never really appreciated it until just this past year. &#160;The food there embodies exactly how Chinese food should taste like so both thumbs up for me :) My family went back to this place last Sunday after church for Dim Sum. Their Dim Sum is fresher and much tastier than before. Service is outstanding. Love it! Reviews looked good so we went, even though I had heard that this place was not that good and we had eaten before at their place on S. Jackson and had been disappointed.We live in the neighborhood so ordered To Go. The order was ready and the food was still warm, so far so good! Got it home and have to say that this will be a meal that we'll NEVER forget!The chicken in the Gen Tao's was hard, I had to get a steak knife to cut it into smaller pieces. The sauce tasted and looked like sweet and sour sauce, not spicy and just kind of poured over the chicken. There were about 4 stalks of broccoli on the side. We also ordered the Egg Fu Young which was greasy and fairly tasteless with a sauce that was little more than brown water. The Egg Fu Young itself looked like it had been made ahead and then put on a steam table, not fresh and fluffy like we've had elsewhere.The worst part was that the steamed rice tasted like it came from a box... Wow.I was trying to figure out why our food was so bad: we ordered around 5:00pm so they hadn't run out of anything and when we went to pick up the food the place was empty, so not like they were really busy. Kind of odd though, the parking lot was full... very weird.We really wanted to like this place since it is so close to our house. However, they probably did us a favor by being so unremarkable, now we don't have to go there all the time! I tried the Dim Sum and Shrimp and Lobster sauce and it was great. The servers were friendly and helpful. In use yelp to select where I am going to eat and this place is worth putting on my favorites list. Try them out, you will like it. Normally when we are craving dim sum, we head downtown and go to the Jade Garden. As we didn't feel like dealing with parking hassles, I went online to find a close dim sum restaurant to West Seattle. &#160;Decided to try Hong Kong Seafood restaurants based on the Yelp reviews. &#160;Parking was easy and plentiful. The space is large, and we were seated immediately. &#160;Unfortunately, the dim sum was just ok. The sticky rice was very hard, as if it had been sitting on the cart for quite a while. several of the other dishes we tried were ok, but nothing was outstanding. &#160;My wife summed it up nicely on the drive home saying that if it were closer to West Seattle, perhaps we would go again, but given the distance to drive and our perception of the food, we will make the drive over to Jade Garden next time we are craving dim sum."

Hong Kong Seafood Restaurant had plenty of parking. As we walked into the building, I thought the decor was almost austere compared to other Chinese restaurants.We were seated right away, and got chrysanthemum tea (in which I later found a little bug...) without us asking for it. (I prefer Ti Kuan Yin or Puerh Tea...) Some of the dumplings from the steam cart were pretty and tasted not too bad. However, two kinds of pan-fried dumplings we got were cold. We requested one of the floor staff to microwave them for us; he disappeared into the kitchen with the 2 plates of dumplings. He came back with the plates a little bit later. Unfortunately, the dumplings were barely lukewarm.I like my hot food hot and cold food cold. The restaurant was getting noticeably busy with other guests. I understand and am OK with slow service. I do not, however, appreciate compromise on the quality of food. Came for dim sum, everything was pretty good. I loved that their sticky rice came as 2 big ones, and not 3 little ones like most other places nowadays. The egg tart wasn't as good as other places, but the shrimp dumpling and noodles were good. Price seemed reasonable too. Will definitely come back. We just ate here for dim sum, and I have to say that this the worst dim sum I've ever had. &#160;First of all, a lot of the food were cold, and many of the outer wrap/skin of the dim sums were hard and dry and not edible ... The food was definitely not fresh. &#160;Some dishes were served in extra large bowl so they can charge us more money. &#160;The common BBQ pork pastry was also disgusting, instead of the pastry being crispy and flakey, the whole thing was very soggy. &#160;Because the food was so bad, we didn't order very much, and the total bill still came out more expensive then other dim sum restaurants. &#160;Oh, and one more thing, no one ever came to take away the finished trays either, so the table was very cramped an the whole experience was not enjoyable. &#160;Tea is a big part of dim sum, I always have a choice of the type of tea I want with other dim sum reaturants, this place never asked me and the tea was very bad too. I would recommend going to Joy Palace or Jade Garden instead."

It would definitely fill your dim sum needs. Variety was decent also. Service was excellent for a Chinese restaurant. Well, maybe people in Seattle are just nicer all around, but definitely hospitable and will go the extra mile for you. That in itself is hard to find in dim sum houses around the world. Prices were more than decent. Quite inexpensive actually. Less than anything we've ever paid, and we were more than adequately stuffed. by the way, bathrooms were clean also. Great variety for dim sum, especially for not even being in the ID. They had a congee cart, a steamed cart, a baked cart and a dessert cart making the rounds.The carts came through quickly, and actually came back to offer seconds. The ladies were a little pushy, but not too bad. And all of the food was actually hot!Prices are fair too - nine plates cost $30. My family and I were on our way to our usual dim sum at joy palace, but we figured we should try something new. So hk seafood was on the way.. All in all, the business was a lil slow, although we were there around 1130. The staff was friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, I think the reason why they were friendly is because we spoke the language. Anyways we ordered the shui mai (ok), chicken feet (awesome, tender/soft like butter), spare ribs (ok, not as tender as i'd hope), bean curd wrap (ok), the deep fried tofu with the shrimp on top (disappointment! 1)not enough sauce 2)lack of flavor with that minimal sauce; all in all, Im complaining about not having enough flavorless sauce) and some other things I cannot interpret into english. None the less the food was hot , it wasnt joy palace or jade garden but it was enough. We were full with a bunch of left overs but we had to get egg tart!The egg tart was yummy! Although, i'd say the tart n egg ratio isnt on the spot. I dont think theres enough egg &#160;The bill came out to be 31 n some odd change. Not bad, we'll be back. I tend to only leave reviews when I'm upset or very happy... And I judge the stars based on the quality of the food more-so than the service and atmosphere.My sister and I went late at night. At about 9 (they close at 10) and they do dim sum all day. While we were there, they were only taking orders. That was great though, everything was very fresh. They brought things out as they finished so that we got everything hot. It was good. I'm not usually a big fan of shuy mai but theirs is delicious. By far the best I've had to date. All of the shrimp dumplings (steamed and fried) had great flavor and texture. Nothing tasted like it had a bunch of filler products to cost less. (whether it does or not, I don't know, but everything was very good). There are certainly a few things we will try when we go back. Because we will most definitely be back soon! :) I don't really have a favorite dimsum place. I like dimsum house in renton. this was good. They just seem to bombard you with everything and don't listen.the food was good though. they are pretty authentic and they are pretty fresh. I would probably go again. Good waiter service is hard to find. keep looking. Overall the dim sum is quite good. I am surprise to find such decent dim sum. I like the chicken feet, siu mai and bean curd wrap dumpling. They remodeled recently and ambient is good.However, taro cake was cold.congee was ok as it was quite flat in terms of taste Great dim sum! I love their sticky rice pork thing. Their egg custards are soo yummy!I also love their pea vines!! The lobster I had there was pretty good too. The flavors are amazing. I recommend it to those who love lobster, you can't go wrong with it. Brought in a friend's mother that was diabetic and told the wait staff that she was so that they could accomodate. They brought out steamed fish, ginger green onion lobster, and some garlic pea vines. It was amazing. Everything was so fresh and you can taste it because nothing was lathered with sauce like other chinese restaurants. The steamed tilapia had a light soy on it and went great with the steamed fish.The Lobster itself was sweet so they didnt have to do anything to it but accent it with green onions and ginger. The pea vines were extra fresh and crispy. Light garlic and pinch of salt made the freshness stand out. The parents loved it and i got an extra star in their book =0) Thanks Hong Kong restaurant! My husband and I come here with family for dim sum on weekends and for dinner on weekdays when we don't want to cook. &#160;The food and service are consistently good and we recommend this place to everyone! Check it out!! I have come to realize that I am truly turning into a food snob. &#160;I just expect quality for a fair price. &#160;Here you will get quality dim sum, friendly service, fast and the food is all of great quality. &#160;By that I mean some dim sum restaurants will not de-vein the shrimp and expect the customer to just eat the poo...Well not here. &#160;This dim sum is fresh and priced fair. &#160;I have ate dim sum at perhaps some 20 establishments and this is by far the best in every way. &#160;Give them a try, you won't be disappointed. &#160;Very crowded on the weekend but those carts come around frequently. &#160;Thanks! We've been eating here for the past 10+ years. Food is great- so happy they re-opened. &#160;Dimsum is delicious - &#160;my kids love their congee and my &#160;husband loves the chicken feet. &#160; Everything on their menu is good- my favorite is their Peking duck - but you'll have to order ahead of time."

Also, their brown rice is just amazing and much different that the classic brown rice you will have anywhere else. Its more red than brown and very sticky too.I have never had to wait for a table at Tawon (unlike Jai Thai), and the service here has always been great as well.Definitely put this place on your dinner list the next time you are in Fremont. Tawon is and average but clean Thai restaurant that has plenty of space. It's a good place if you have a party of four+, have children, and want an in an out experience. You don't have to wait for seating here - Ever. As for the food.... Well that's average too. For some reason it tends to be on the greasier side. However, It's cheap, good and satisfies.If you are a Thai food lover (like myself) and want to enjoy a really healthy lunch or dinner then don't be fooled. There are far better Thai restaurants around to choose from. &#160;Wheelchair friendly I would give this place four stars is for the Pad Thai which I think is the best in the Fremont/Wallingford nexus of Thai restaurants(Seriously in our hood there are more Thai Restaurants than Thai people!). &#160;However, the lack of depth puts it in the average &#160;category the other dishes are good, but really not memorable. &#160;Nevertheless if you go with a group you will now know to grab the Pad Thai and leave the curry for the other folks. &#160;The Pad Thai is less sweet than the other places and has just the right zing to it. &#160;Very fresh veggies and condiments upon request as well. &#160;The decor is very nice, almost too nice as sometimes when I want pad thai its on a day when Im not dressing up...but nice enough to take your grandmother too for sure. &#160; Parking can be a pain and it does cost now...Thanks Mayor McGinn! &#160; I recommend parking up the hill and walking down to avoid the draw bridge area. Positives: Chicken sataySummary: Cute ambiance and semi-good service (depending on what you like), I really wish the food had been better. I was pleasantly surprised by the ambiance of the restaurant. Clean and very open and considering the moderate Yelp stars, it was much nicer than I had expected.The service was confusing. It was very difficult to get their attention to order more dishes, or to get limes, or even to get the bill, but they were incredibly, almost annoying, insistent about removing any plates that were not currently in use despite the fact that we were one of three tables. They were also really good about filling the water. We weren't the only ones to get this strange service either. When we were leaving, we overheard another table getting hassled about whether or not they were going to split one of the dishes because they wanted to remove the excess dishes/bowls.In terms of quality, the chicken satay appetizer (though small) was my favorite and perhaps the only redeeming dish. It boosted this review from one to two stars. The chicken was very tender and moist. The cucumber salad was delicious, sweet, and crunchy. My only grip is that for about $5, I expected more than two tiny pieces of chicken and a quarter cup of salad.If only the other dishes were nearly as good!The Pad Thai was an overcooked pile of bland noodles, and scrambled eggs on top of sprouts. The flavors were okay, but really lacked the bold Pad Thai flavors that are usually associated with the dish. The Seafood Tom Yum Soup had loads of seafood, but was mild on the lemon grass and other associated Thai flavors. Also, we ordered it super spicy, ""four stars"", but it was only mildly spicy. I came here with my boyfriend since on the recommendation from his coworker. Supposedly it was his favorite Thai restaurant.This place is a lot bigger than I expected from the outside. It's really spacious and the decor is nice.I had the beef pahd thai while my boyfriend had this chicken massaman curry.When I got my pahd thai I was a little skeptical because the coloring looked weird. All good pahd thai I have had all usually have this orange sauce thing going on, so when this came out looking like just plain noodles on a plate I was super worried.But it was AMAZING, comparable to my favorite thai restaurant. The massaman curry was good too, but I feel like it's really hard to mess up curry.In general everything was great. Food was good and the service was good. I walked in on my way to work and ordered my food to go.The heat was perfect, the food was tasty, and it was fast - Granted, I came in when they just opened and no one was there.I've seen their to-go on http://eat24hours.com and I've walked by going to work numerous times, which is why I wanted to check it out. The interior feels spacious, and the Eastern design made an 80 degree weather day in Seattle really feel like I wasn't in Seattle. I wish I could have stayed under the fan and eat there.I haven't eaten in-house at this thai restaurant in years, but it is definitely on my list. Uhm, they're okay. Their food isn't that great. Service is pretty good. But I think i've had way better thai. They are all nice and nice service, but I would prefer other thai places. Arriving in a snowy Seattle &#160;&amp;gt;it snows in Seattle???&amp;gt; &#160;after a two hour flight from Norcal makes for a big appetite. So my gal pal took me to Tawon Thai for a late lunch since I was in the mood for thai food. We were immediately seated in an almost empty dining area (musta been all the snow keeping the lunch crowd away). &#160;Our server brought out glasses of water and small bowls of delicious seaweed soup. &#160;I ordered the pad see ewe with chicken, medium hot and my gal pal ordered red curry chicken. By my estimation, my dish was pretty good and let me tell you. I estimate pretty darn well. The gal pal thought her dish, which she always orders when she visits, was not up to her standards. Hmmm... maybe a different cook, perhaps? &#160;Anyways, I washed my meal down with some thai iced tea, which was especially delicious. &#160;It snows in Seattle? Maybe it was because I got take-out or something, but the Pad Thai was essentially tasteless. I've gotten better food from a mobile food truck. On top of that, their spiciness was way off. Maybe it was just this dish.I would not go here again. It was too expensive for mediocre food. This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Seattle...and I've lived here my whole life. &#160;AND, i have lots of food allergies, but Thai food is one of the few I can have. &#160;Definitely the best Phad Thai and Phad Woon Sen around. &#160;My boyfriend also loves the Phad Kee Mao.Will never go back to Jai Thai. This is my favorite Thai place in Seattle, and Thai is my favorite food. The have all their veggie options listed with a 'j' which makes things easy. &#160;They have great vegetarian selections, tofu comes soft or fried and the brown rice is purple. This is a good thing. They also have the lunch special every day. Ive had Phad Thai, Pad See Ew, Pumpkin Curry, and lots more. love this place. I have to subtract three stars for the terrible experience we had at Tawon Thai this past week. &#160;The food was good. &#160;But the service was so maddening. &#160;We had just come from the gym and were very thirsty. &#160;My partner asked the waitress whether there were free refills on sodas (that were $2.) &#160;She said, no they don't offer refills, and he said ok, I'll just have water. &#160;Not a big deal. &#160;The waitress then proceeded to go back to the kitchen, tell all the other waitresses and then they laughed and laughed and talked about it FOR THE REST OF OUR MEAL. &#160;Is it really that big of a deal? &#160;What the F***? &#160;I don't want to pay $2 for a soda that is $.03 and have to pay for each of them? &#160;I'm not debating the merit of free refills vs. not free refills - BUT, honestly? &#160;If I choose not to purchase a soda because of this, why would you spend 30 minutes laughing and making fun of us for this? &#160;It turned an otherwise tasty meal into a bad experience - and made us mad enough we won't be back. &#160;If you can stomach the waitresses immaturity - great. &#160;But there are too many other Thai places in Seattle to waste your time here. I had the Tom Yum noodle soup for lunch and thought that the dish was only alright. It didn't have the hotness or sourness that I typically associate with Tom Yum. &#160;Also, it is weird to have a dish with ground chicken because it all on the bottom of the bowl. My favorite Thai restaurant ever. &#160; The pumpkin curry is spectacular. &#160;The brown rice actually looks purple but is tasty all by itself. &#160;I go here anytime I am in the area or can make an excuse to get there. I've eaten at many a Thai restaurant in the Seattle/Bellevue area. Some are better then others but until this restaurant opened I didn't realize how much I truly love this food when it's done so well. Since it's opening, Tawon Thai has consistantly given me not only great food but also great service. I'm never waiting for anything. The food always arrives quickly after an order and it's perfectly cooked with just the right amount of everything. I may sound a bit like I'm fawning over this restaurant but it's all true. If you've had a different experience then I suggest that you give them another try. Best Thai restaurant in the county, hands down!"
